9,8,Epilogue
9,10,I'd like to thank Dr. Aquaa for buying a volume of ebooks.
12,3,Welcome to the afterlife, Mr. Fujisawa. You've just died an unhappy life, but your life is over.
12,4,In the white room, I was suddenly told such a thing.
12,6,I don't know what's out of the ordinary.
12,7,There was a small office desk and a small desk in the room, and the person who told me the end of my life was sitting in that chair.
12,9,If there is a god-woman, she must be talking about the other person before her eyes.
12,10,It's completely different from the pretty looks of the idol that you see on TV. It's very humanly distinct.
12,11,A long, clear, water-colored hair that gives a soft impression.
12,12,I wonder if I'm as old as I am.
12,13,It doesn't come out too much, it's not too perfect, it's pale, it's pale, it's purple, it's white, it's white, it's plain, it's wrapped in a loose garment called a feather.
12,14,The pretty girl stared at me with her hair's color and clear, water-colored eyes glancing her eyes, and her cheery cheers filled her eyes.
12,17,...I remember the memory I had so far.
12,19,.
12,21,I usually didn't go to school, but today I went out unusually.
12,22,I got up a strange early and lined up in order to get a popular video game and its first limited version of today's game.
12,23,I hear the world is calling out that people like me are out of control.
12,24,I got the game safely caught, and then I went home, and then I was going to go home to play the game, and then I was going to go home to get my hands on it.
12,25,The girl who was walking right in front of me with her arms tied.
12,26,From the way I dress, I wonder if I'm a student at the same school as I am.
12,27,When the traffic light turned blue, the child went right across the street without looking right or left at Lok.
12,28,It's a big shadow that's on the way to being next to a girl.
12,29,It must have been a big truck moving fast.
12,30,I pushed him before I thought about it.
12,32,And...
12,34,...with a strangely calm mind, I asked the pretty girl in front of me quietly.
12,35,Can I ask you just one question?
12,36,A pretty girl nodded at my question.
12,37,Would you like that?
12,38,The girl I pushed, is she alive?
12,39,It was important.
12,40,It was my first and last show in my life.
12,41,I'm too sorry if I didn't get there in time.
12,42,"He's alive, isn't he?"
12,43,I'm glad...
12,44,My death wasn't a lie. At the end, I could have done a little good....
12,45,The pretty girl who sees me in my relief is able to bend her neck.
12,47,"Well, if you hadn't pushed her, she wouldn't have been hurt."
12,49,"What's the... what's the...?"
12,50,What's he doing now?
12,51,"That tractor actually stopped in front of him. It's just around the corner. I don't even know how fast it is. I mean, you've done too much with your heroism."
12,52,I don't know what she is. I don't know what she is after meeting her for the first time.
12,53,I don't know what to do, but I'd like to hit you with a hell of a beating.
12,54,...no, wait. Rather than that, I heard something worse right now.
12,55,"What is it now?" "What's the tractor?" "Not a truck?"
12,56,"Yes, I'm a tractor, but even that girl will realize that if a large truck comes near her, she will run away."
12,57,What is it?
12,58,"What, then, do you mean my cause of death was cultivated by a tractor?"
12,59,"No, it's a shock death, but you died in shock because you knew you had been run over by a truck. I've been doing this work for a long time, but you're the first person to die in such a strange way."
12,60,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
12,61,"You're scared of being run over by a tractor, you're incorrigible, you're incorrigible, and you carry it to a nearby hospital.
12,62,"Oh, no! I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear it!"
12,63,When the girl came up to me with her ears closed, she would smile in my face, and she wouldn't bother to hear me.
12,64,"Your family has rushed to the hospital now, but before you grieve, the cause of death has not even occurred in your family..."
12,65,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
12,66,A girl who looks down on me with her head held in her hand and laughs at me with her hands at her mouth.
12,67,Let's keep my stress release like this. My name is Akaa, and in Japan I am the goddess who leads the young dead.
12,68,He... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he...
12,69,No, let's be so proud because we can't keep talking.
12,70,"Do you want to be born again as a human and live a new life?"
12,71,What kind of options do you have that doesn't have a lid?
12,72,"No, no, no, no, no, it's... it's... it's like a heaveny place.
12,73,I'm sorry, but there's nothing in heaven. If there's no TV, there's no play or game. Those who are already dead, they're dead, so there's no point, and there's no point in talking to them forever or forever.
12,74,What's that? I don't know if there's any entertainment for playing games, but heaven is more a prison place than Heaven.
12,75,But I'm going to be a baby and I'm going to start over again...
12,76,No, it's probably the only option.
12,77,Seeing me so sorry, the goddess gave me a full smile.
12,78,"Well, you don't want to go to heaven, do you?
12,79,I don't know, it smells so great.
12,80,Aqua said to me, "Hey, I'm a watcher."
12,82,"You... like games, don't you?"
12,84,Aqua might begin to explain some good stories and things like that.
12,85,When I sum up the story, it was like this.
12,86,There is a world that doesn't belong here, that is, a king who lives in a foreign world.
12,87,And it seems that the world is pinned on by this invasion of the Chaldean army.
12,88,In that world, there's an evil spirit, there's a monster.
12,89,In other words, there's a fantasy world like a famous game, a dod request, and a mofmov.
12,90,The people who died in that world, they weren't killed by the Dark Lords, so they were scared of what they did. Most of those who died refused to be born in that world, so clearly, there will be no babies, and the world will perish. So what's going to happen?
12,91,What an immigrant policy!
12,92,"So, if you're going to send someone who died young, you're going to send him a body and memory, so it doesn't make sense that he's going to die soon, so there's only one thing that gives him the right to have something he likes in the other world.
12,93,I'm sure it doesn't sound bad.
12,94,It's not that it's not that it's not that it's just that I'm getting nervous.
12,95,I know I like games, but I can't believe I can go to something like the world of my favorite game.
12,96,And before that.
12,97,"Well, I'd like to hear it, but what's going to happen to those words? Can I speak a foreign language or a foreign language?"
12,98,"There's no problem with that, thanks to the kind support of our gods, you can either put a weight on your brain or learn it at the very first moment when you're going to a foreign world. Of course, you can read letters.
12,99,"Now I heard something serious. Did you say that your luck would be bad?"
12,100,I didn't say.
12,101,I told you.
12,102,Even though I've had no sense of humor so far, and my opponent's a self-assembled woman, I've already had a crush on myself.
12,103,...but this is certainly a very powerful and fascinating proposal.
12,104,I'm afraid that I might become a pa, but I'm not proud of myself, but I've had confidence in luck since I was a child.
12,105,And Aquaa offered me something like a catalog in front of me.
12,106,Choose only one. Let's give you the power that no one else can give you. For example, it's a powerful special skill. It's a legendary weapon. Let's give you one right to go to a different world.
12,107,In Aqua's words, when I receive that catalog, I try to draw it at a parallel point.
12,108,...there were all kinds of names written in it.
12,109,Is it true that you have the ability to take it from amongst yourselves or that you want to choose your equipment?
12,110,Oh, my God, this is all I've got and I'm going to turn around.
12,111,I mean, it's the gamer's hunch, but these are all sensations of impromptu skills and equipment.
12,112,If you go to a foreign world with magic, I'd like to use magic.
12,113,So this is still the ability to assume magic...
12,114,"Well, do it quickly, but no matter what you choose, I'm not looking forward to being a game nerd, so you just pick something and leave quickly."
12,115,"Oh, I'm not a nerd.
12,116,As I said in my little shaking voice, Aqua was chewing the branch of her hair at the end of her hair and wasn't interested in me at all.
12,117,It doesn't matter, so hurry up, and after this, there's a lot of other dead people waiting for you, right?
12,118,As I said, Aqua was sitting on his back and he didn't look at me.
12,119,...he's the first person you've ever met, and he's laughing at people's cause of death, and he's just a little cute enough to get on with it.
12,120,Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
12,121,You want me to decide quickly?
12,122,Then I'll decide.
12,123,"You can take it to a different world."
12,124,"Well, I'll see you later."
12,125,I pointed to the aqua.
12,126,Aquata looks at me with his flint face, and he's wearing a snack.
12,127,"Well, then, don't get out of the middle of this prosthesis..."
12,128,After saying that, Aqua stopped working with Hata.
12,129,"What did you just say?"
12,130,And then it was.
12,131,"Yes, thank you." "Then I'll take over the work of Mr Aqua from now on."
12,132,Out of nowhere, with a white glow, there appeared a woman with a single feather.
12,133,...in a word, like an angel.
12,134,"What?"
12,135,Under my feet, there appeared a blue flash of magic under my feet.
12,136,Oh, what is this?
12,137,Are you sure you're going to the other world?
12,138,"Hey, what's this?" No, no, no, no, no, that's crazy! It's not right to bring a goddess!
12,139,I can't see my eyes, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it.
12,140,To that aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
12,141,"Mr. Aquaa, I'll leave the rest of your business to you. If you've knocked down the King safely, I'll send someone to get you home or to pick you up. In the meantime, I'll leave it to you to take over your work."
12,142,"Wait! Wait! I'm a goddess, but I can't fight!
12,143,The angel who showed up suddenly gave me a soft smile, with a crying apothecary around his butt and a soft smile on his ass.
12,144,"I'm going to send you back to a foreign world. As one of the bravest candidates to kill the beast, I'll give you a gift from the gods."
12,145,A gift?
12,146,I'm going to ask him for a parrot back.
12,147,The angel smiled calmly.
12,148,"Yes. A gift that matched the great men who were trying to save the world. I'll give you just one wish, however you wish."
12,149,"Oh, my God!"
12,150,I mean, do you have any wish to go back to Japan when you're tired of being in a foreign world?
12,151,For example, when you get tired of living in a foreign world, you go back to Japan and you're rich and you're surrounded by beautiful girls and you're playing three different games!
12,152,"Wait! It's my job to say such cool things."
12,153,An angel suddenly showed up to take the job and cry.
12,154,I was already satisfied just seeing the Aqua.
12,155,I'll point straight at the Aqua.
12,156,"How does it feel to be taken by a man who's been making fun of you?
12,157,I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
12,158,"Come on, brave man, and from amongst the many candidates for courage, I pray you will defeat the Monkey King.
12,159,"Oh, oh, oh, my Slyhu!"
12,160,The angels are strictly telling the treat.
12,162,I was wrapped in bright light with a screaming Aquaa...!
13,4,1
13,6,All around the city of stone, carriages clattering.
13,8,"It's... it's a different world." "Hey, hey, it's really a different world.
13,10,I shuddered in excitement at the sight spread before my eyes.
13,11,It's like a city in medieval Europe, with brick houses lined up.
13,12,Cars and bikes aren't running, telephone poles aren't there, and towers are not there.
13,13,I'm like, "Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
13,14,I toured the city with the Japanese and watched the people going about their business.
13,15,It's beautiful, it's beautiful, it's an elf!
13,16,"Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
13,17,I turned around and looked around at the aqua screaming next door with its head in its mouth.
13,19,What if they think I'm a crazy girl?
13,20,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
13,22,As soon as she screamed, the goddess started to cry at me.
13,23,"Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
13,24,If you shake off Aqua's hand, which tries to choke me with tears, you'll put your hands on the stinky face.
13,25,Then Aqua raised his hand to the ground and made him fight.
13,26,"What are you talking about? I'm in trouble because I can't go home!
13,27,The aqua was crying, so she was so upset that she was all over her head.
13,28,She's such a beautiful girl who can't be honest with herself.
13,29,Don't worry, old lady. This is the bar. We'll go to the bar and start with the information collection. That's the order in the roll-playing game.
13,30,You can call me lady, but if you don't, you'll be able to call me "Aaa," but it's not an adventure to destroy people. The world is different, but it's one of the gods of this world.
13,31,Aqua might say that, and follow me behind me with confidence.
13,33,Well, there must be an adventurer's union to fight against such a king-god, or Guido, an adventurer to hunt down monsters.
13,34,I mean, after thinking about it, Aqua is a goddess, and I think I should ask him a lot of questions.
13,35,"Aqua, this is the place of Guild the adventurer. Where should I go?"
13,36,When I asked Aquaa, she had a cold look on her face.
13,37,I don't know if you know this world's common sense at any time, but I don't know anything about the city.
13,39,He can't use it.
13,41,I don't have a choice, so I ask my aunt passing by.
13,42,Asking a man is a dirty opponent, a smudge, and a young woman, my chicken heart has a lot of difficulty.
13,43,"I'm looking for some adventurer Gildian..."
13,44,"Hey, you don't know Guild in town by any chance, do you?"
13,45,I'm also relieved that my aunt said that she had a Guido.
13,46,"Hey, I've traveled a little bit from a distance. I've just arrived in town."
13,47,"Oh, come to this city, I wonder if you're trying to be an adventurer. Welcome to Aquil, the city of adventurers. If you go straight down this street and turn right, you'll see a sign."
13,48,"You're going straight to the right, aren't you?"
13,49,It's the city of running adventures.
13,50,I see. It's an ideal place to start sending dead people into a different world.
13,51,I thanked my aunt and walked along the road where I was taught, and Aquaur, who followed me around a little behind me, made a sad sound while she shared a slightly different look of respect.
13,52,"Hey, why are your hands so tight when you're such a man and you don't have any friends?
13,53,It's not a bad thing to have no friends or friends. You can't measure a person's worth without having no friends or friendly love. Don't put down your hikitto. I'm only 16 years old, and I'm only 16 years old, if you say it in the world.
13,54,Aka, who's called a bitch, chokes her neck, ignores it, and goes into the adventurer Guild.
13,56,- The adventurer, Guild...
13,58,An organization that never fails to show up in the game, who fails to do business with adventurers, or who backs up the game.
13,59,In other words, he's the halovat of the other world.
13,60,It was a pretty big building, and there was a smell of food in it.
13,61,I'm sure there's a rough spot inside.
13,62,You might see the newcomers and get involved in them all of a sudden.
13,63,If you go inside with such determination...
13,64,"Oh, hello, I'm here. If it's a work guide, go to the back counter and have an empty seat for dinner!"
13,65,The short - haired waitress's sister came out with a friendly welcome.
13,66,It seems that the bar has been combined in the dark and thin inside of the shop.
13,67,There's a bunch of well-dressed men all over the place, but there's no one in particular who looks bad.
13,68,But still, the attention is focused on the rareness of the newcomers.
13,69,...and I noticed the cause.
13,70,"Hey, I don't know if you've seen this stuff, but I'm sure they know it's a god or a goddess that's been bothering me."
13,71,This silly-looking goddess looks like.
13,72,If you keep quiet, this pretty girl will be attracted to your eyes.
13,73,In the meantime, let's ignore the gaze and carry out our original purpose.
13,74,I think it's your job to get the least you can live in this world.
13,75,"I don't know. My job is to send dead people to this world. But I understand. I don't know the game, but I have a common sense and a promise in this world. Should I register as an adventurer too?"
13,76,That's what I'm talking about. Let's go.
13,77,I'll take Aqua with me and head straight straight to the counter.
13,78,There are four receptionists.
13,79,Two of them are female employees.
13,80,I'm going to the receptionist's section of the women's staff.
13,81,Why did you come all the way here when you had three other receptionees?
13,82,You don't know anything that's stuck behind me. I taught you in a low voice.
13,83,"It's basic to keep close to the receptionist of Guild, and there's a lot of flags with the beautiful receptionist's sister. From now on, we'll be waiting for some amazing hide-and-gosss.
13,84,I'm sorry, but I'm going to put you in line for a second.
13,85,Even though the others are empty, the rest of the receptionists are taking the trouble to look at us in the procession and the rest of the receptionists are ignoring us.
13,86,Soon our turn will come.
13,87,"Yes, what did you do today?"
13,88,The girl at the reception is a charming beauty.
13,89,The giant could have been the chimp of an adult woman.
13,90,"Well, I'd like to be an idiot, but I've just come from the country and I don't know anything..."
13,91,If you say you're from a country or from a foreign country, the receptionist will tell you a lot of things.
13,92,"I see." "Well, well, it's going to cost you a registration fee, but are you sure you want to be a good husband?"
13,93,Well, that's the basics of the Tutorial.
13,94,If you follow the receptionist's advice...
13,96,...recorded fee?
13,98,I'm like, "Hey, do you have any money?"
13,99,And I said, "Well, you know what?"
13,100,Can't you lend me first money or leave me behind?
13,101,I'm going to have an operation meeting with Aqua once I'm away from the front desk.
13,102,What do I do? I don't know what to do with the game, but I usually get the minimum amount of equipment and the cost of living.
13,103,"I suddenly lost my trust, but I can't help it. It's my turn. I'll show you the true nature of the goddess."
13,104,I don't know if it's a Shinto robe. I don't know if it's a shrine dress.
13,105,(Laughter)
13,106,"President, tell the sect!
13,107,I wasn't sure whether it came from above or from below, but I was asking for money.
13,108,I'm... I'm an Elyssian.
13,109,"Oh, that's right, I'm sorry..."
13,110,I'm not sure, but I'm afraid I was a different sect.
13,111,When the Aqua might be lonely and try to leave with Sobo, the stamp stopped calling.
13,112,My uncle, Miss Aksinya, is an Aksinya, but I think the god Akaa and the goddess Ellis are in the middle of a relationship with each other. This is also the edge of something, and I've looked at it for a while, but I don't have any fees. Don't take it, if that's the case, take it along with you.
13,113,"Yes, I'm sorry..." "Thank you..."
13,115,I got the money and came home with my eyes like dead fish.
13,116,I couldn't believe that she was a... goddess, but... anyway, Ellis is my senior goddess.
13,117,I said, "Well, well, that's okay. If you believe in a goddess, then it's going to be a problem!"
13,118,He said that he had come home with a face like he had lost something important, and I would encourage him properly.
13,119,"Well... I brought you a registration fee."
13,120,The registration fee will be one thousand Elliss...
13,121,The money Aquaur got from the stamp was 3,000 Elliss.
13,122,Aquaa tells me that I've been given 3,000 yen's worth because it looks like I'm going to pay for it.
13,123,The receptionist who doesn't want to see us or Aqua.
13,124,It seems I broke the flag with this sister at the starting point.
13,125,Now, since you say you want to be an adventurer, I think you both understand to some extent, but the simple explanation is... the adventurer is the monster who lives outside the city... who is responsible for the destruction of anything that harms people.
13,126,Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. This is it.
13,127,As for adventurers, it's this: work, jobs, classes, whatever your name is called, but you choose the fight-free style you choose here.
13,128,It's better to have a flashy style than a plain-looking guy who says he's a warrior.
13,129,The sister at the reception offered each card before me and Aqua.
13,130,It looks like you've seen it.
13,131,You know, all the things in this world hold in their bodies the souls of the living, the living, or the dead. You can absorb some of the memories of their beings by slicing them into some other life activity. They can't usually be seen with your eyes.
13,132,Your sister pointed to part of the card.
13,133,If you have this card, then you will also see the experience values that the adventurer has absorbed.
13,134,That reminds me of what Aqua said.
13,135,"You like games, don't you?"
13,136,I see. As far as I can tell, it's a game.
13,137,I'm going to ask you two to fill out these documents with features such as height, weight, age, and physical size.
13,138,In the papers offered by my sister, I'm going to write down my character.
13,139,Five feet tall and weighing 55 kilograms. Sixteen years, brown hair and brown eyes...
13,140,"Yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you both for touching this card so that you can see your status, so please choose a job you want to meet in response to that number.
13,141,Oh, you're getting faster, aren't you?
13,142,This is where I have such an amazing ability to dive and get in trouble with the Guido.
13,143,I touched the card with faint anticipation while holding back my thoughts.
13,144,"Well, thank you, Mr. Sutokazuma, for your strength, your life force, your skill, your skill, your skill, your skill, your skill... and so forth... unless you have such a high level of intelligence... well, it's a very good number... but you don't need much luck for adventurers... well, there's only one job you can choose that is a basic adventurer.
13,145,Hey, suddenly the adventurer's life was denied. What's going on?
13,146,Then I want to hit Nimah and Aqua with a smile next door.
13,147,If I'm weak, you're in trouble too.
13,148,"Well, uh, I'd like to be an adventurer..."
13,149,With the look on your face that you're worried about your sister.
13,150,"Well, you can change your job if you go up to a higher level of status, and say, "Well, you know, this adventurer's career has all sorts of occupations, so that the title of the general adventurer..."
13,151,"In return, you need a lot of points to learn and you don't have the same skills to correct your job."
13,152,I'll water your sister's words in two seconds.
13,153,Should he really throw it away?
13,154,Apparently, I'm a basic job or an early class.
13,155,At any rate, I think I've got the lowest job.
13,156,Even so, I'm the kind of adventurer that comes out in the world of the game.
13,157,If I take a card written down with my name and it's a professional adventurer...
13,158,"Oh! Oh! Oh! What?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
13,159,The sister who saw Aqua's touch card raised her voice.
13,160,There's only one way to do this.
13,161,That's usually my event, isn't it?
13,162,"What do you mean, "What do you mean, I'm great?"
13,163,Even if it rots, does that mean it's a goddess?
13,164,But it seems that Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-thing got on the move and hated it very much.
13,165,You can't do anything else if you're a wizard who's in need of high intelligence.
13,166,At your sister's question, Aquaa has a bit of a problem.
13,167,"Well, I'm sorry I don't have a job as a goddess...
13,168,Welcome to the mad-ass Guild. We're all looking forward to seeing you again!
13,169,That's what your sister said, and she smiled with a smile.
13,170,What is this?
13,171,These events should happen to me...
13,173,Well, whatever.
13,174,So the life of adventurers in the foreign world began.
13,176,2
13,178,"Oh, thank you so much! That's enough for today!"
13,179,Thank you. I'm so tired!
13,180,"I did!"
13,181,In the final voice of the master's approval of his work, Akaa and I bow our heads with greetings when we receive the dues.
13,182,And I said, "Well, I'll see you guys in a minute."
13,183,"I'll see you later."
13,184,"Hey, good work! Don't ask me again tomorrow!"
13,185,When I say hello to the seniors, Aqua is followed by me.
13,186,While listening to my seniority's voice, Aqua and I left the scene.
13,187,Oh, I worked a day's work, too.
13,188,It's hard for me to believe that I was involved.
13,189,Me and Aquaa hold on to the day's sun and head for the city's public bath.
13,190,The public bath is about the same as the money bath in Japan.
13,191,Compared to Japan, baths are expensive when compared with the average wage of one person, but you can't stop them even if they're a little higher at the end of the job.
13,192,I'll come back to life.
13,193,A hot hot water boat will dip you down to your shoulders, and heal your work fatigue slowly.
13,194,It's a medieval place, and I thought baths were a luxury in a foreign world, but it seems that it was my own idea.
13,195,Thank you...!
13,196,When I got out of the bath, Aqua was waiting for me at the entrance to the bathroom.
13,197,I don't care if the wind is longer than the woman, but this is all the Japanese who like to take a bath.
13,198,"What do you want to eat today?" "What do you want to eat today?"
13,199,"Well, I like meat, too." "Then why don't you go to your inn and ask your dad for a smoke wizard's pair of hamburgers?"
13,200,"No objection."
13,201,If you and Aquaa are satisfied with a flat diet, we'll go to the stable. We don't have anything to do, so we'll go to the stable.
13,202,Then I picked a straw and put it on the floor, and then I lay down quickly.
13,203,There's an Aqua lying next to me as usual.
13,204,"Well, then, good night."
13,205,"Well, good night." "That's right. I've worked very hard today too."
13,206,And here I am, to a deep sleep, as well as a pleasant fatigue...
13,208,"No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
13,210,I woke up with Mkri.
13,211,"What's wrong? Did you forget to go to the bathroom before you went to bed?
13,212,"No, no, no, no. I don't think so. Why do we usually do workers like us?"
13,213,That's right.
13,214,For the past two weeks, Aquaa and I have been working on an extension project outside of the city for the past two weeks.
13,215,I mean, the construction crew.
13,216,It's far from the adventures I've been looking for in this world.
13,217,I don't know. Aquaa has no question about it.
13,218,You're just a woman of God.
13,219,"Well, you can't eat without working, can you?
13,220,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm looking for a fight with a monster that won't sweat!
13,221,It got hot and loud, and when we heard it all around us, the curse went off.
13,222,"Hey, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
13,223,"Oh, I'm sorry!
13,224,The first adventurer is poor.
13,225,It's not normal to take a room in a room and sleep at night every day.
13,226,Generally speaking, you'll spend money with other adventurers in the big room, sleeping with fish and stuff.
13,227,Apparently, like we do now, we rent a stable and sleep on a straw.
13,228,Yeah, it's completely different from what I expected from living in a foreign world and living an adventurer's life.
13,229,Living in a hotel is like sleeping in a hotel every day in Japan.
13,230,It's far from impossible for an insecure adventurer of income.
13,231,...that's right, my income is unstable.
13,232,There was no such thing as a simple herb picking like the one you saw in the game, nor a quest like that of a monster near the city.
13,233,If you take down the monsters at random, you won't get any money.
13,234,It seems that the monsters who lived in the woods near the city were driven away by the old parallel fences.
13,235,There's no monster in the safe forest, and few people bother to ask for money until they're willing to pay for a sample.
13,236,That's true.
13,237,Even children will come out of town normally.
13,238,There are gatekeepers, but it's better to get rid of monsters that do so much harm if they don't make it in and out than to keep security.
13,239,It's obvious to me, but I didn't want to know so much about such a realistic thing.
13,240,I've only been in the woods for half a day and I've been collecting herbs that are easy to recognize even an amateur with hair on them. I can make money for the hotel and three meals that day.
13,241,There's no way there's such a good job in reality.
13,242,In view of this, even in Japan, which is a prosperous nation on earth, there's no hotel life and no job at all.
13,243,What's so good about it?
13,244,This is such a different world.
13,245,"Oh, don't tell me this is the most distant city from the castle of the Monkey King! You don't dare come here to attack a city with such a border and only an adventurer!
13,246,I can't hear a sound on Aqua's honest opinion.
13,247,Well, Aqua and I don't even have the least adventure tools and equipment we need. We used to go to work for safe ground work to get them first.
13,248,"It's about time I got tired of doing all the hard work... I didn't come to the foreign world like the workers. I came here to take down my computer and my game, but I was sent here for adventure. Did I?
13,249,"What are you talking about? What are you talking about?"
13,250,"Oh, by the way, that's the story. I forgot I was so absorbed in the pleasure of work. But if Kazma hadn't beat him, I couldn't go home."
13,251,In a very silly reply, that's how his sister told him that his intellectual status was lower than that of other people.
13,252,And I said, "Well, let's cut it down! Let's burn it down!"
13,253,"You know, I'm really nervous... but I'm counting on you! I'm counting on you!
13,254,Leave it to me!
13,255,"You can't do it! You can't do it! You can't do it!"
13,256,"I'm sorry."
13,258,Even though I apologized to other adventurers, I fell asleep in my heart.
13,260,3
13,262,There's no cloud, under a clear blue sky.
13,263,"Oh, oh, oh, help me!"
13,264,I'm like, "Oh my God, I can't do this! I can't do this! I can't do this! I can't do this! I can't do this! I can't do this!
13,265,All right, let's bury this guy later and go home.
13,266,I was determined to do so, and I was being chased by giant frog monsters, Giant Toads, and I was running for help.
13,267,The vast plain outside the city.
13,268,We asked for a quick rush at Gild, but we came here...
13,269,As the minimum necessary weapon, I'll use shortsaws.
13,270,Speaking of Aquaa, if the goddess didn't shake her weapon desperately or paint it, she would say stupid things, and now she'd stare at me being chased by a frog.
13,271,These guys don't look down on frogs.
13,272,Its big body is bigger than a cow, and when it grows more and more rapidly, it appears to be able to grow its strength for egg laying, even to the more fed population, and to turn the sheep and mountains of farmers into a fold.
13,273,Since the goat is called a goat, neither I nor Aquar.
13,274,In fact, it is said that every year at this frog's breeding season, children and farmers will be missing their mark.
13,275,He looks just like a giant frog.
13,276,But it's a monster that's so much more dangerous than a weak monster that's been eliminated in the neighboring neighborhood of the city.
13,277,By the way, the meat has some hardness, but it's sharp and white, and it's very delicious as food.
13,278,It's said that the thickness of the smudge is a sharp shot, and that it will prevent a blow-out of the system.
13,279,Because I hate metal, if only my equipment was good enough, it wouldn't be easy to get caught, and it would be good enough for some daze-doucheter there.
13,280,So, a good adventurer likes to hunt these guys...
13,281,"Aaaah! Aaah!
13,282,And I said, "Well, why don't you start with me?"
13,283,"Mr. Aquaa!"
13,284,Later on, he'll bury his neck down to the ground and make him feel afraid of being hit by frogs.
13,285,I see a frog jumping behind me while I cry half the time.
13,286,But the frog had already turned in a different direction than I had run away.
13,287,At the end of that gaze...
13,288,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
13,289,Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- b- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- and a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a---.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................
13,290,I suddenly saw that the frog that was chasing me had stopped moving.
13,291,From the tip of the frog's mouth, there's a very white stuff growing.
13,292,That white one...
13,295,"Aaah! Hey, you guys aren't being eaten!"
13,296,The legs of the frog are crawling from the edge of the frog's mouth, shaking and shaking.
13,297,I pulled the shortsaw and ran for the frog!
13,300,"Wuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh."
13,301,Before me, I was standing on my knees on the ground, crouching on my knees, and crying in the face of a frog's saliva.
13,302,Then, next to me, there was a frog that had been crushed in the head by me.
13,303,"What's wrong with you?"
13,304,Pulled out of the frog's mouth, Aquaa has been crying for a long time.
13,305,It seems that the driftstone goddess responded well to her prey.
13,306,"What's the matter with you? Aqua-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A- A- A- A- A- A- A- A- A- A- A- A-...
13,307,To be honest, the fact that I was killed by an amateur was so great that the frog that ate the aqua was trying to stop its movement in order to catch the catch.
13,308,You don't have the courage to face a frog coming up against me in a good way. You don't have the courage to face it face to face.
13,309,But Aqua stands up with its saliva all over its body.
13,310,If the faithful see me now dirty, don't let me down! If they find out that you've pulled back to the frog, they'll lose the name of the beautiful lady who is already beautiful!
13,311,Don't worry about it. When you see it, when you see it, it's like you're covered with fluid.
13,312,But Aqua started running toward a frog in the distance before I could stop it.
13,313,"Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
13,314,Without hearing my restraints, Aqua was separated from the frog, and he kept running, and he hit the frog in the belly with a white light in his fist.
13,315,"The power of God, remember that there was a block in front of me, and that I had a tooth in God's hand!
13,316,It's true that Guild's staff told me that a hit-up attack wasn't very effective.
13,317,The frog's soft belly was wrapped in fists and beaten to the ground, as if nothing had happened...
13,318,Looking at each other with a frog, the aqua becomes swollen.
13,319,(Laughter)
13,320,... ...I stopped trying to swallow the prey.
13,322,4
13,324,"Well, you two can't do it. Let's apply for company!"
13,325,When we returned to the city, we were the first ones to go to the public baths and clean up our mess, and the adventurers Gilad were also the frogs, and the frogs were in the game meeting.
13,326,This adventurer, Guild, is also used as a meeting place for adventurers, and it is a combination of buying and buying monsters that have been cut-out and drinking places where monster food is sold.
13,327,Today I got two frogs, so I sold a frog to Guido, and that's where I grew up.
13,328,That huge frog can't be carried by two of us.
13,329,But if I ask the Guild people, they'll give me a transport service for the fallen monsters.
13,330,The discount price of a frog is 5,000 Elliss for transport service.
13,331,To be clear, I found that working on the land didn't change much from my wages and earnings.
13,332,However, I was surprised to see a little hard-core frog in the middle of nowhere.
13,333,When I first came to this world, I had resistance to lizards and frogs, but they were served as regular meals, and when I tried to eat them, I found that many of them were surprisingly delicious.
13,334,The goddess in front of me, with no hesitation, ate a single meal of any kind.
13,335,"But do you think there's someone who's going to party with us and we're going to party with them?"
13,336,Whenever he had a mouthful, the frog's hide was covered with meat, and he shook the fork in his hand to the right and to the left.
13,337,"If you've got a smudge, you're in trouble."
13,338,"Drink it up. Then swallow it and talk to me."
13,339,It's not just the mouth. It's the mouth. It's the mouth. It's the mouth. It's the mouth. It's the mouth.
13,340,"I'm here, so if you want a partner, why don't I just go ahead and ask you to join me? I'm going to have all kinds of recovery techniques, and I'm going to be able to use my magic, and I'm going to be able to heal myself, and I'm going to be able to get my hands out of my throat. It's because of Kazma that I'm down on the ground, and I'm going to be far away from my original power.
13,341,I was worried when I saw a goddess who said she was going to take the pepper off my plate.

13,345,The next day, in Guild, the adventurer.
13,346,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's not... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
13,347,Aquaa was lonely.
13,348,We've already been waiting for more than half a day for a man-made English candidate in the future.
13,349,It seems to me that stucco isn't missing from other adventurers.
13,350,There are many other adventurers who are looking for a party other than us. But they interviewed one another and took them somewhere after they had a laugh.
13,351,I know why no one comes.
13,352,"Well, let's put down the hurdle, because the purpose is to cut down the forest and destroy the king, so I can't help but...
13,353,"Well... because..."
13,354,The job of being an adventurer in this strange world has the status of a higher position.
13,355,Aquarius is one of them.
13,356,To say so to ordinary people, it's a candidate for heroism.
13,357,Of course, such a brave candidate has already been treated to another party...
13,358,Aqua might want to be as powerful as possible in order to cut down the magic king.
13,359,But...
13,360,I don't know if you're going to come here, but I'm going to be the weakest guy in the world, and I'm going to be the only elite in the world, and I'm going to be the narrowest shoulder in the world.
13,361,It was when I said that and tried to get up.
13,362,(Laughter)
13,363,A sleepy, lazy, squirming red-eyed look in your eyes.
13,364,And the black, delicate texture of hair, the length of hair which can reach or not reach to the shoulder.
13,365,The one who called out to us was a girl who wore a black cape, a black robe, a black boots, a cane, and even a toddler's hat. She was a typical or an ostentatious girl.
13,366,It's like a doll's face... a Loli's face.
13,367,It doesn't seem unusual that children are working in this world.
13,368,I'm sure she's only about 12 years old, and she's blindfolded with her eyes, but she's small and thin, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place, and she's all over the place.
13,369,"My name is Akwizard!
13,370,You came here to cool down?
13,371,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
13,372,When I stepped into the girl's self-assembly bowl, she was in a hurry to deny it.
13,373,No, what are you doing?
13,374,It's like, "What's wrong with you?"
13,375,When the child nodded to Aquaa's question, he crossed his dirty card and handed it to Aqua.
13,376,"Why don't I have a brilliant wizard who can break mountains, break rocks... ... ... ...and who's a great wizard... ...and who hasn't eaten anything three days longer, but if I can, why don't I have something to eat before an interview?"
13,377,Megumi said that, and looked with sad eyes.
13,378,At the same time, there's a nice, uncut sound coming from around the side of the wall.
13,379,If you're hurt, why don't you get him to fix it?
13,380,This is my most powerful and powerful magical magic item... and if this happens to be removed... then there will be a great disaster in this world.
13,383,It's like a seal.
13,384,"I'm sorry, please don't pull me!"
13,385,When I explain to Kazma, they are born with great intelligence and strong magical powers, and I want to confiscate them, with the special, red eyes that mark the origin of their names... and each of them has a strange name.
13,386,Aquaa told me that I was pulling the eye band of Megumi's.
13,387,I thought you were making fun of me.
13,388,You'll be able to free your eyes and try to relax.
13,389,"I'm not rude to a strange name. I think the people in town are making more weird names than the people in town."
13,390,"Can I ask you the name of your parents?"
13,391,"My mother's sore. My father's so nervous."
13,392,"It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
13,393,Me and Aqua-a-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-T.
13,394,And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's true, but... but, uh... well, this girl's kind of a good wizard, right?
13,395,"Hey, if you have anything to say about my parents' names, let's ask them."
13,396,Aquaa will return the adventure card to me as soon as he comes close to me.
13,397,"Isn't it true that adventurers' cards can't be forged, and she's a high-ranking wizard, an arc wizard, and an arc wizard, and I think you can expect them to have high magical value too. If you really can use the explosive magic, that's great, if you're told that it's hard to master it, and it's hard to master it, is it?
13,398,"Hey, I want you to call me by my name, not her."
13,399,I handed the store's menu to you in case you're going to argue with me.
13,400,"Well, you can ask me to do something for you." I'm Kazma. This is Aqua. Nice to meet you, Ark Wizard."
13,401,She took the menu silently while she looked as if she were going to say something.
13,403,6
13,405,"The blasting spell is the strongest magic. It will take a lot of preparation to use magic. Until you're ready, I'd like to stop that frog."
13,406,We had brought a full belly bowl, and we had come to Rivenji in that Jainttoud.
13,407,In the plains and in the distance, when do you see the one frog?
13,408,The frog was coming after us.
13,409,But I can see another frog moving toward me from the other direction.
13,410,Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
13,411,I'm like, "What's going on here?"
13,412,I couldn't help but wonder at the goddess who was trying to choke me with her eyes tears.
13,413,"A goddess?"
13,414,She's a sad little girl who calls herself... sometimes talking about things like this, but I want her to leave it as much as possible.
13,415,I can't help but look at Aqua with sympathy at my words.
13,416,The tear-eyed Aquaa grabbed her fist and ran for the nearest frog.
13,417,"What's wrong with a frog that's hard to shoot, but this time I'm going to show you the power of a goddess!
13,418,Even if you scream and don't have the ability to learn how to get into the frog's body successfully, it will soon get stuck, and you will continue to stop a frog.
13,419,It's said that zishi is a goddess, sitting on her back and making time to earn money.
13,420,...and the air around the barn trembled with a brusque shaking.
13,421,I could see that the magic she's trying to use is in trouble, even if I didn't know it.
13,422,The voice of the magic-sharing broom increases, and there's a sweat coming from the edge of the spoon.
13,423,"Look, this is the best and most powerful way to attack a human being.... This is the ultimate attack magic."
13,424,The light also lit at the end of Megumi's cane.
13,425,It's so bright, but so bright, it's so bright that it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's so bright, it's...
13,426,I'm looking at you, but your red eyes are shining brightly and shining, and you're looking wide open.
13,427,"Explor John!"
13,428,There's a flash of light running through the plain.
13,429,The light, released from the tip of the Wand, is thrust into the distance to be sucked into by an approaching frog...!
13,430,Right after that, there was the effect of a vicious, evil, and evil trick.
13,431,The sound of intense light and the shaking of the air all around, along with the roar, the frogs burst and burst and burst.
13,432,Even though I'm about to be blown off by a tremendous blast, I'll step on my feet and cover my face.
13,433,When the smoke blast cleared, the frog's location had a crater of more than 20 meters and told of the awesomeness of the explosion.
13,434,Is this magic?
13,435,That's when I'm impressed by the magic power of Yuuki.
13,436,Did you wake up at the sound of magic and a sharp shot, or did a frog crawl out of the ground?
13,437,I was wondering how these frogs could survive in this plain, where there is no rain, and there is no water source, and under the sun, but it's not supposed to be in the ground.
13,438,The frog is trying to crawl near the fence, but its behavior is very slow.
13,439,Why don't you take the frogs off the frog along with this duplicate and have them wipe it off with the explosive magic of the far end?
13,440,"When do you think you'll be able to take a long walk and then attack?"
13,441,When I go that far and turn around,
13,442,I'll just stop moving.
13,443,There was a gurney lying on the floor.
13,444,In summary, I'm not sure if a frog will come out of the vicinity.
13,446,I stab my dick in two frogs that have been caught in motion by the Aqua-A-A-A-T-A-T-A-A-T-A-T-A-A-T-A-A-A-T-A-A-T-A-A-A-A-A-T-A-A-A-A-A-D-A-A-A-A-D-A-A-A-D-A-A-A-D-A-A-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-H.
13,447,Somehow, within three days, I've managed to complete my quest to kill five Giant Toads.
13,449,7
13,451,"Uh...uh...uh... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah... ah...
13,452,After me, my liquefy, sticky aquaa will follow me with a quick, crying cry.
13,453,"The frog's inside, it stinks, but it's warm...
13,454,She was as sticky as Aquaa and was teaching me knowledge I didn't want to know, but she was standing on my back.
13,455,It seems that those who use magic, if they use magic beyond the limits of their magic power, will use it instead of it to cut down their life force.
13,456,It's said that if you use a large spell in a state where the magic is both dry and dry, it can be life-threatening.
13,457,"From now on, you're not allowed to blow up magic unless it's the quickest of times. From now on, other magic will make you hard-core."
13,458,I put all my energy into my words and my back, and my hands held on my shoulders.
13,459,I can't use it.
13,460,"What can't be used?"
13,461,In the language of Megumi, I return the word with a parrot.
13,462,However, with more effort on my hands, his thin chest was pressed against my back.
13,463,I can only use the blasting magic.
13,464,Are you serious?
13,465,I'm serious.
13,466,While I'm feeling calm again, I've been snoring my nose until now, Aqua is finally joining the conversation.
13,467,"What do you mean we can't use anything but blasting magic?
13,468,A skill point?
13,469,Oh, no. Guild's sister said he had to learn skills.
13,470,After seeing my face like that, Aqua would explain it to me.
13,471,"The art point is that you get it when you get it, you get it when you get it, you get it when you get it. The more initial point you get, the more skill you learn.
13,472,I'm like, "What's that for?"
13,473,Aqua might ignore my question and continue.
13,474,"There are only a few kinds of skills that you can learn by profession or by individuals. For example, if you have trouble with water, you need more points than you normally do, the worst or the worst, and you don't have the ability to master.... So, the explosive magic is a complex attribute, and you need a deep knowledge of fire and wind. That is, if you can master the magic of an explosive system, then you can easily master the magic of other attributes."
13,475,"If you can use the top magic, how can you not use the bottom magic?"
13,476,With my back, the chrysanthemum came to a halt.
13,477,It's not like I love the magic of the explosive system. I just like it.
13,478,What's the difference between blast magic and bomb magic in the first place?
13,479,I don't know what that means, but Aqua is listening to the pure white on his face.
13,480,No, I'm already more concerned with party crafts than with that.
13,481,"Of course, if you take other skills, you'll just have to take this basic skill of fire, water, soil and wind.... But it's not possible for me to love this attribute.
13,482,And I said, "Well, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, and I'm impressed by the way you're looking for Roman, even though it's inefficient."
13,483,No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
13,484,It's clear that Aqua is in harmony with it.
13,485,In my fight with these two frogs, I'm wondering if this goddess couldn't be used at all.
13,486,To put it clearly, even Aqua might be the only one who's having trouble with any more children...
13,487,Okay, I've made up my mind.
13,488,"Well, I'm sure it's the right way to go, but good luck. Well, I'm about to see the city. Let's split up the news when we get to Guild. Well, if there's another chance, we'll see each other somewhere."
13,489,The word put force into the hand of the man who was holding me back.
13,490,I don't think I'd be paid for anything if I could get you to give me food and other expenses. That's right. My power as an archwizard, it's just a little over the cost of a long time!
13,491,"No, no, the power of it isn't for a small party like us; yes, the power of it is for us to be rich and rotten. A regular wizard is enough to get us started. See, I'm the weakest adventurer."
13,492,As I say so, I try desperately to loosen the hand of the stick that clings to me so that I can get rid of it as soon as I get to Guild.
13,493,But my hand won't let go with it.
13,494,"No, no, I'm still a senior, but I'm still running, and I'm still six, so I'm sure if you get a little higher, you'll end up falling down. So, don't try to pull my hand off me."
13,495,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, he's a wizard who can only use one shot a day, he's got to hold his hand in a way that's unexpected! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go! Don't let go!
13,496,"Don't leave me behind! I won't pick up any party anymore!
13,497,The passers were looking at us and mumbling and shouting, "Don't throw it away" because they didn't want to leave their backs.
13,498,Since we're already in town, the only reason to look at it is because it's a good aqua, or it'll stand out.
13,499,That guy, he's trying to throw that little boy away...
13,500,I'm gonna... I'm gonna have a girl with some sort of mucous fluid next door.
13,501,You're such a piece of shit that you can't take a little girl with you and throw her away.
13,502,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
13,503,It seems that Aqua didn't like what she was doing when she heard it.
13,504,And I'm afraid I heard it in my mind too.
13,505,When I look at the bowl on my tall shoulders, it distorts the shape of his mouth...
13,506,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
13,507,(Laughter)
13,509,8
13,511,"Yes, I'm sure I've killed five Jaianttoads within three days. I've been very grateful for the completion of the quest."
13,512,After reporting to the adventurer Guild's receptionist, he will receive his prescribed reward.
13,513,The aquamarines, which were covered with mucous mucous liquids, were so graphic that they could cause me some misunderstandings that I quickly rushed to the public bath.
13,514,Although the frog that killed the frog tried to destroy itself with a blast spell, I was wondering what would happen to the mission report, but the adventurers' cards are going to record the kind of monsters that fell and how many lives they're going to take.
13,515,When I showed him my card and the card I had taken from the wallet, the receptionist manipulated the strange box that seemed to be on the counter and finished the check on it.
13,516,Although it's probably the result of the development of perjury instead of science, the technology of this world is often too stupid.
13,517,When I look at my card again, it's written as an adventurer level 4.
13,518,I hear that frog is a monster of the sort that is more likely to rise to the level of adventurers.
13,519,I caught four frogs and four frogs by myself, but that was enough to bring the level up to four at once.
13,520,The lower the human level, the faster the growth seems to be.
13,521,The status figures on the card are getting a little higher, but I don't feel like they're getting too strong.
13,522,And I said, "Well, you know, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do that."
13,523,I didn't like it.
13,525,The sister at the reception said at the first explanation.
13,526,Everything in this world holds a worthless soul in its body. It can absorb part of the memory of its existence by eating, or killing any creature, or by stinging into some other life activity.
13,527,This place is really like a game.
13,529,If you look closely, the card is written as a skill point, and it's shown there as three.
13,530,With this, I can learn skills, too.
13,531,"Well, then, we're going to combine the purchase of two Jainttoads with the quest's achievement, and we're going to make 11000 Elliss."
13,532,Ten thousand.
13,533,That huge frog buys at least 5,000 yen at the cost of moving.
13,534,And the reward for killing five frogs is 100,000 yen.
13,535,According to Aquaa, it's going to be between four and six people who party together.
13,536,So, in the average adventurer's match, two days a day and two days of fighting at the stake, five frogs deal and reward, and if it was a party of 125,000 yen per person, the share per person would be 25,000 yen.
13,537,It doesn't pay.
13,538,If the challenge is finished in one day, it will be twenty-five thousand yen a day.
13,539,But I don't think it's good enough for a hard day's work after a hard day's work.
13,540,In fact, if I had had another frog today, I would have been eaten, and no one could help me, and I would have been completely destroyed.
13,541,I can't even think about it.
13,542,When I looked through other ventures, the ones that stood in line...
13,543,"and the harvest of Egill's trees, and the reward, and the glory, and the glory and the glory and the glory, and the glory and the glory and the glory and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and all these things, and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and the power and all the power and all the power and all the power and all the power and all the power and all the power and all the power and all the power and so so so were and all these things,
13,544,I need you to find my lost pet, the white wolf.
13,545,I'd like you to teach me how to use the sword in the breath of a child... except for the Loon Knight or the soothsay master.
13,546,I'm looking for a training platform for magic experiments, a strong body force, strong magic, a vulnerabilities...
13,547,Yeah.
13,548,It's not easy to live in this world.
13,549,The second day after the start of the adventure, I wanted to go back to Japan.
13,552,"I'm sorry, may I have a word...?"
13,554,When I sat in a little boy's room nearby, when I was getting homesick, I heard a sound from behind.
13,555,When I was exposed to the reality of a different world, I turned around with a gloomy look on my face.
13,556,It's like, "That's right, it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
13,557,And I looked at the Lord of Voices and said it out loud.
13,559,The women's horse.
13,561,That's also a very beautiful one.
13,562,The beautiful woman with a nice look and a cool impression was staring at us in the face.
13,563,His height is younger than mine.
13,564,My height is 165 centimeters.
13,565,I wonder if it's about 170 if it's a little higher.
13,566,She was a beauty of the eye-eyed, hairy gold gold, wrapped in hard metal armor.
13,567,I wonder if I'm one and two years older than I am.
13,568,I don't know what the shape is because of the armor, but the beauty was something of a color.
13,569,I don't know what to do with my cool face, but I don't know what to do with it. I don't know what to do with it.
13,570,What do you do when you look at me like that?
13,571,And I said, "Well, what is it?"
13,572,Unlike the same age, Aquaa and his younger sister, they're not like the older ones. They're like the older ones, so they're like the older ones, and they're just a little louder.
13,573,The long struggle for survival is a curse.
13,574,I wonder if this gathering is going to hire you for a party anymore.
13,575,The knight showed me a piece of paper.
13,576,Speaking of which, after putting the bowl into the party, there wasn't enough paper for the recruitment.
13,577,"Well, the party members are still looking for you."
13,578,"You've got to get me out of here! You've got to get me out of here!"
13,579,My hand was trying to turn me down, and the knight burst into tears.
13,580,What?
13,581,"Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
13,582,A knight held my hand in his hand in his blink of an eye.
13,583,And I said, "Well, I'm not sure if you've ever seen anything like that before, but were those two so-and-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-sos and so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-sos.
13,584,"What?"
13,585,What did this sister say now?
13,586,"No, it's not. It's just two girls who aren't old enough to see it happen to them. I don't think I'm a knight. I think I'm an advanced knight named Krusider.
13,589,What's wrong with this knight? I thought he was a calm, quiet sister!
13,590,And my critical sensor is responding.
13,591,I think this is the type of guy that leads to Aqua-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-T.
13,592,She's beautiful, but I can't help it.
13,593,"No, I've been trying to say this, but I don't know what's useful to one of my friends, and one of my friends can only shoot one magic shot a day.
13,594,There's more strength in the hands of the knights.
13,595,"Well, then it's even more convenient!" "Well, actually, it was a little difficult to say, but I'm not sure about the long-term tolerance I have when I'm strong.
13,596,I'm afraid my sensors were right.
13,597,That's why I'm a senior, but I don't have to worry about it. I'm getting out before the cancer, so I want you to use my shield to get used to it.
13,598,The knights come to see me in a chair with a clean face.
13,599,My face is so close!
13,600,I'm the one who's looked down on because I'm sitting, but my knight Sara's hair money is excited over my cheeks.
13,601,There's long-term damage in this place!
13,602,No, it's just during adolescence, the stabs are so strong and so strong that they're so high.
13,603,Calm down! Don't let the fragrance distract you!
13,604,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, my party is too poor, so I'm really going to be attacked by you. That's possible that's what monsters are going to do to you every time!
13,605,That's what I want.
13,606,"Oh, that's it. Today, two of my friends were so often eaten by frogs that they were covered with saliva! That could continue every day."
13,607,That's what I'd rather wish for!
13,608,I understand.
13,609,A knight holding my hand with his red tide.
13,610,When I saw that, I realized.
13,611,...he's not only capable, he's not good enough, he's not good enough, he's not good enough.
14,4,1
14,6,"Hey, I'd like to ask you how you do it when you learn skills."
14,8,The day after the frogs were cut down.
14,9,We were having late lunch in the bar in Guido.
14,10,In front of my eyes, there's no money, and he couldn't eat the dirty stuff until he met us, but he was upset and ate a regular meal, and Aquaa ordered that he catch a handy clerk and replace it.
14,11,It's a delicious meal, which I don't think is a very old woman.
14,12,...there's no trace of color in two women at a man's Harm party.
14,13,If you hold on to your fork, I'll raise my face.
14,14,"Are you going to learn skills, or are you going to learn skills from what you're doing on a card, or from what you're currently able to learn at the moment..." Oh, the trade is a scoundrel, and the early adventurers are going to get someone to teach you how to do skills.
14,15,I see.
14,16,I'm sure my sister of reception said that the early adventurers were able to master all their skills.
14,17,Which means...
14,18,You mean, if you tell me how to do it, I'm going to be able to use a bomb that's illegal and crazy?
14,19,That's right!
14,20,"Whoa!"
14,21,I can't help showing my casual words an unexpected bite.
14,22,"That's right, Kazma! I'm going to eat the points necessary to learn, but adventurers are going to use explosive magic just a little bit apart from the arc wizard. I'll teach you anything else if you want to learn how to do it. Is there any other skill worth learning?
14,23,My face is so close!
14,24,I'm like, "Hey, I'm falling down, calm down, Rory boy!
14,25,(Laughter)
14,26,Since it's hard to talk about, I ask Aqua.
14,27,"If the adventurer wants to learn how to blow-up magic, it won't take 10 or 20 of skill points. If he keeps up the level for about 10 years and doesn't use a single point, maybe he can learn."
14,28,"I don't know if I can wait or not."
14,29,"What's the matter with you?"
14,30,I was shocked by my words, so I ate a regular meal again, while I was dazed.
14,31,But since my profession, my career, and my adventurers have the only advantage of being able to master all their skills, I'd like to learn a lot of the skills that are easily available.
14,32,"Oh, you probably have a lot of useful skills, don't you? Tell me something that's easy to teach. Don't use too much points to learn and feel good about it."
14,33,To my words, Aqua will grab a glass of water and think for a while.
14,34,"I can't help but tell you, my skills aren't half-fifty, are they?"
14,35,It's a hard-to-do approach, but since I'm in a position to be taught, I'm very proud of myself here.
14,36,I nodded to a strange god and observe Aquaa use his skills.
14,37,"Then watch this glass first, and put the glass of this water on your head so that it doesn't fall on your head."
14,38,I'm a little nervous, but I put a cup on my head in the same way as Aqua.
14,39,Then put something on the table where the aquaa got it from, or one grain per pound.
14,40,"Come on, play this seed with your fingers and put it in the glass with one shot.
14,41,I'm like, "Who's this woman who told me I couldn't see her?"
14,42,Yes...?
14,43,For some reason, it seems that the Aquaa was shocked, followed by a bump and began rolling with fingers on the seed on the table.
14,44,I don't know what you're depressed about, but I want you to put down the cup on your head because it stands out.
14,45,I'm like, "What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?
14,46,It's a sudden voice from the side.
14,47,As you can see, there were two women at the next table.
14,48,It's the girl in well-dressed armor who has called out to me.
14,49,There's a small knife wound on the bush, and she's a pretty girl with a bright silver hair, with a bright atmosphere.
14,50,Next to it is a long blonde beauty with a full plate maeler in it.
14,51,It's cool, it's awkward, it's scary, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool...
14,52,That's right. That woman who wanted to come to the party the other day was the matron.
14,53,Will a thief's child be one and two years younger than I am?
14,54,And I said, "Well, how do you do that?"
14,55,To my question, a girl who's a bandit has a nasty temper.
14,56,You're just an early adventurer, aren't you?
14,57,That's cheap!
14,58,I thought, but if I thought about it, I would teach her skills, and she wouldn't be at risk.
14,59,If I really want to teach you how to steal, you can rely on other thieves there.
14,60,And I said, "Yes, please, I'm going to take one cold klim zombie."
14,62,2
14,64,I'm a thief, as you can see. I don't love you so much. Did I talk to you a bit yesterday? I don't think he has any skills that would help you.
14,65,"Ous! I'm going to call you Kazma. Chris, please!"
14,66,The square behind the adventurer Guild.
14,67,The three of us, Chris, and Dukeness were standing in an empty square.
14,68,By the way, I left the two of my friends behind because they were all stuck at the table.
14,69,"Well, let's start with enemy detection and hiding. There's no trap in town like this.
14,70,Okay.
14,71,Duquenes objects as he was told.
14,72,Then Chris goes into some distant tar and puts out only his upper body.
14,73,Then he threw a stone at Dukenes' head, what he thought, and hid himself in the tar.
14,74,Are you going to say that this is some kind of hiding skill?
14,75,... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
14,76,Daknes, who has been hit by a stone, walks silently to a single tar.
14,77,"Friend Sensor Sensitive... I'm going to feel the sensation of the dacquenes' rage!
14,78,He's been knocked down on the side of every hidden tar, rolled around, and Chris is screaming.
14,79,I'm sure this will really teach you skills...
14,81,"Well, let's try to do one of my best skills and thefts. It's a weapon that the opponent holds tight, but it takes everything at random in the back of the bag. The chances of success are based on the value of good luck.
14,82,Chris, who was rolling all the tar and looking around, will come back and explain the theft.
14,83,Sure, stealing skills are going to work very well.
14,84,Besides, being lucky depends on my only high status.
14,85,"Well, I'm going to use it for you, okay?"
14,86,As Chris cried out with his hands in front of him, there was a little thing in his hand.
14,87,That's...
14,88,"Oh, my wallet!"
14,89,My money is so thin that I have no money.
14,90,"Oh, that's right! I'm going to use it like this."
14,91,Chris tried to give me back my wallet, and then he smiled.
14,92,"Well, why don't you try to remember your quick, fast - stealing technique? So you can take one thing from me with a stick. It doesn't matter what's inside my wallet or my weapon. It's worth more than what's inside my wallet. Whatever you take away from me, you'll switch it to your own wallet.
14,93,He's the one who suddenly starts to say terrible things.
14,94,But, and I think.
14,95,I'm afraid I have a high rate of luck...
14,96,You can take anything away from them...
14,97,That doesn't mean they won't get anything if their skills fail.
14,98,I'll... I'll do it.
14,99,What's the matter with you? It's like taking possession of a bunch of mean-hearted traitors.
14,100,Well, it's finally become an adventurer's event in this world!
14,101,When I put my adventurer card together, I made sure that it contained a new box of unlearnable skills.
14,102,If you press it with your finger, you'll see four skills.
14,103,I'm going to show you one point of enemy detection, one point of hiding, one point of theft, five points of flowery month.
14,104,Is this a party where Aqua was putting seeds in a cup?
14,105,You've got to be kidding me! You've got to be kidding me!
14,106,I don't care about banqueting, but first of all, I learn the skills, thefts, enemy perceptions and hiding places in a card.
14,107,The third point of skill points will be consumed and the remaining skill points will be zero.
14,108,Let's see if we can learn skills like this.
14,109,"I learned fast, and I got on that race! Don't cry no matter what you steal!"
14,110,You told me to stick out my right hand and Chris laughed at me.
14,111,"That's good! I like the good guy! Come on! What's going on!
14,112,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That's crazy!"
14,113,I saw the stone that Chris had taken out, and I couldn't help but argue with it.
14,114,If you think I'm confident, this is what I'm going to do!
14,115,It's true if you have a lot of garbage items, you'll be less likely to be robbed of important items, and that'll be your strategy.
14,116,"This is a teaching fee. It's not the sum of any skill. There's a counter-intuitive strategy for any skill like this. I've learned one! Let's try it!"
14,117,Come on, you son of a bitch, you certainly got a good study!
14,118,And when I watch Chris laugh with his heart full of joy, it makes me feel like a fool and I feel like a fool.
14,119,This isn't Japan, it's a world of weak flesh and blood.
14,120,It's his fault he's being deceived.
14,121,Besides, just because the game has gone bad doesn't mean it's still going to be a bad prize.
14,122,"All right, let's do this! I've been lucky for a long time!"
14,123,At the same time as I screamed, something was held firmly in my right hand that I pushed out.
14,124,Although I said success is dependent on luck, when I see success in one shot, it seems that I'm still lucky.
14,125,If I expand what I've got and take it seriously...
14,126,"What is this?"
14,127,It was a piece of white cloth.
14,128,I spread it out with both hands and looked at it in the sun...
14,129,(Laughter)
14,130,I said, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
14,131,Chris held down his skirt and cried out for his eyes to cry.
14,133,3
14,135,When I learned my skills and went back to Gild's bar, it was quite a mess.
14,136,"Mr. Aquaa, again! I'll pay you for the money, please!
14,137,I'm going to buy you something, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it, and I'm going to buy it.
14,138,For some reason, there was a crowd all around the familiar Aquaa.
14,139,And I'm not a entertainer, so I can't take money with tricks! That's the least feeling of those who do it. And the flower moon wasn't meant to get to you.
14,140,Aquaa is interested in Chris, who sits next to me in tears, pushing through the public air, smelling and falling down.
14,141,Then Duquenes opened his mouth before I could explain it.
14,142,"Well, Chris is only depressed and depressed by the fact that he gives a lot of money to Kazma."
14,143,Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's not wrong, but wait.
14,144,I've been crying for Chris's money to pay him back. I've only told him to decide for myself the price of his return.
14,145,And if I'm not satisfied with the price I'm offering, I'm sure Chris's feelings will be embraced as our home treasure.
14,146,In the end, I've offered my wallet and my wallet in tears, so I've taken a change of clothes, and I've got some bad language in the way of Duquenes.
14,147,I was curious about the glances on the Aquaa and the look on the words of Duquenes, but then I looked up at Chris when he was depressed.
14,148,I'm going to be in the middle of the night, and I'm going to be in the middle of the night, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it, and I'm going to be in the middle of it.
14,149,"Hey, wait a minute. It's already cold in the eyes of women adventurers other than Aqua.
14,150,The female adventurer around who apparently heard what he was talking about.
14,151,(Laughter)
14,152,And I said, "Well, you know, I'm going to make a lot of noise, but I'm going to make some money, so I'm going to have fun.
14,153,By the way, Chris has gone to the competition board of adventurers.
14,154,"Well, isn't Mr. Daknes going?"
14,155,I ask the Daquenes, who is still sitting at our table and sitting at our table, with questions that I wonder.
14,156,Because I'm a former guard, there's too much for me to do. Even if I'm a thief, I'm a professional who doesn't have a lot of resources because it's essential for him to search for Danjon.
14,157,I'm sure that's true, but Aquaa also said that ARCPries are rare and drawy, and there's a lot of work to be appreciated.
14,158,Chris, have you found a temporary party before long or will you take a few adventurers and walk out of Guild?
14,159,Chris went out at the risk of coming out and waving his hand at us.
14,160,(Laughter)
14,161,"Danjon exploration is a good way to get in first thing in the morning if it is possible. So we leave for Danjon the day before and camp in front of Danjon until the morning.
14,162,That word of Megumi made me laugh in the face of my enemies.
14,163,I'm like, "What's wrong with you?"
14,164,I pulled my right hand out to scream and toss it out, and there was a tight black cloth in my hand.
14,166,That's right, it's a lot of times.
14,168,"What's that?" "What's that?" "What's that?" "What's that?" "What's that?" ? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
14,169,I'm like, "Oh, wow! That's crazy! It's not supposed to be like this... it's supposed to be random and take something away from me!"
14,170,When the women around me are looking at me, they're hitting me with their fists and tables.
14,171,It was a dacquenes that got up and kicked the kid's head.
14,172,His eyes were so bright...
14,173,Even so, I didn't see any madness in my eyes!
14,174,I don't want it.
14,175,I'm like, "What are you doing?"
14,176,As soon as I got home, Duquenes reded his cheeks and made him tremble.
14,177,I don't know what to do, but this lady's horseman is a very different type of horseman.
14,178,(Laughter)
14,179,"Hey, Kazma, who's this guy?
14,180,I'm like, "Hey, this guy's a cruxider. Isn't there no reason to refuse?"
14,181,I'm going to look at Dukeness and say things I don't want to say.
14,182,Oh, my God. I didn't really want to say no yesterday.
14,183,I certainly didn't want to see these two, but...
14,184,All right, let's go with this.
14,185,It's really a dacnes. Me and Aquaa want to knock down the king who looks like this and looks like this.
14,186,I don't care if I want to go back to heaven or not, but if I'm aware of the harsh reality of this world, I don't care anymore.
14,187,You look like you've never heard of that before next door, but I don't care.
14,188,No, maybe this is convenient.
14,189,"It's just a good opportunity, and listen to me and Aquaa, they want to beat the Witch King anyway. That's why our adventures are going to be extremely cruel or extreme.
14,190,"Oh, you're absolutely right! You've always had sex with a demon lord because it's the work of a knight and it's worth it!"
14,191,I'm like, "What?
14,192,"What?" "What?" "Did I say something funny?"
14,193,I don't know what to do with it. I don't know what to do with it. I don't know what to do with it. I don't know what to do with it.
14,194,...and we're going to do it later.
14,195,Listen to me too. He's going to sell his money to the most powerful person in the world. Aka and I don't need to be forced to stay at that party...
14,196,It's just a matter of time.
14,197,I'm sorry, but I kicked my chair and stood up.
14,198,Swinging around the mantle.
14,199,"My name is Yakuza, and I am the servant of every Red Witch, and I have the power to manipulate the blasting magic, and I am the King, who calls himself the most powerful beyond me!"
14,200,I gathered the gaze all over the gills and made a two-way kitchen declaration of that disease.
14,201,This guy's an eyebrow. Don't look so confident.
14,202,What should I do?
14,203,"Hey, Kazma, Kazma, Kazma..."
14,204,If I'm feeling depressed, Aquaa will pull my sleeves with me when I'm ready.
14,205,"I've been listening to Kazma, and I've been getting a little nervous. Is there any way I can get more fun and get rid of him?"
14,206,You're the most motivated person I've ever known, but you're the best person I've ever known.
14,208,...and then.
14,210,Each member of the city's adventurers, gather to Gild, the first adventurer in the city, gather to Gilard!
14,211,There's a loud announcement all over the city.
14,212,I wonder if they're expanding the sound by magic or something.
14,213,"Hey, what's the emergency quest?
14,214,In contrast to me, I'm a little nervous. The look on his face and on his face is so happy.
14,215,Duquenes said in a loud voice.
14,216,It's about time for the harvest.
14,217,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
14,218,"What's cabbage?" "What's the name of the monster?"
14,219,When I told him how I felt, he looked at me as if he were looking at me as if I were a sad, sad person.
14,220,"A cabbage is a green round one. You can eat it."
14,221,"I'm talking about a very delicious vegetable with teeth that are so shiny."
14,222,And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's true, but you know what?
14,223,I've been working on engineering until recently, but I didn't come here to farm.
14,224,"Well, I don't think you know the kazma, do you?"
14,225,Aqua might say something to me, I'm sorry, but in order to block it out, Guido's staff began to make a loud statement to the adventurers in the building.
14,226,Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure some of you are already aware of it, but here comes the cabbage harvest season! This year's cabbage harvest season has arrived!
14,228,What happened to this employee?
14,230,Then, outside the adventurer Guild, there was a shout of joy.
14,231,I'm going to see how things are going, and I'm going to see how mixed up people are, and I'm going to see green objects flying around the city in such a hurry.
14,232,When I was standing in a scene that I didn't understand, I suddenly found myself sitting next to the Aqua.
14,233,"The cabbages of this world will fly, and as the harvest approaches, they will not be easily eaten. They will cross the continent and the grasslands, and at the end they will not be eaten by anyone and will not be eaten by anyone. Then we will catch them and eat them for food."
14,234,"Can I go back to the stable and go to bed?"
14,235,A group of brave adventurers leaping up and down next to me.
14,236,They, too, are hot places where they are now inspired by the cabbages who live so desperately in their blinking eyes.
14,237,As the adventurers went after the cabbage all the way, I was anxious.
14,239,What's so sad that I have to fight and spread my death against the cabbage?
14,240,I want to go back to Japan.
14,242,4
14,244,Eat a bite of the cabbageed roast that came out of the gills.
14,245,"Why is the cabbage vegetable soup so delicious? It doesn't really make sense."
14,246,In the city where the cabbage had finished hunting safely, the dishes with the cabbage harvests were blown away.
14,247,It's a good money, so I was the one who ended up hunting cabbages, but I'm going to regret it later.
14,248,I didn't come to the other world to fight cabbage.
14,249,"But don't do it! You're a cruxeder!
14,250,"No, I'm just a tough woman, and I'm not fast enough. So if you shake a sword, it's only good to hold onto a wall of someone else's, and it's amazing. You've blown up a bunch of monsters coming to the city after the cabbages. Didn't you think you'd be surprised if you weren't surprised by the other adventurers' faces?"
14,251,"Well, no one could resist in front of my desperate blasting magic... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
14,252,"You know, when I was surrounded by cabbages and monsters and wrapped up in fists and fists, Kazma showed up and picked up the coming cabbages and said thank you."
14,253,And he said, "Yes, it's like a vivid assassin to turn off the scent with his crouching dive skills, to grab the cabbage's movement quickly with enemy sensors, and to force it to attack from behind."
14,254,In time, Aquaa put a flat cabbage plate on the table with a counter.
14,255,In this time of hunting, a goddess who doesn't do anything but chase around the cabbage as she pleases, and who doesn't do anything at all, will be the sweetest of all.
14,256,Kazma... in my name, I give you no name for "Kazma"
14,257,If you call me by that title, I'll knock you off!
14,258,I fell down on the table with my head held in my hand.
14,259,It's an emergency.
14,260,"Well, my name is Daknes. My job is Krüseider. But don't expect me to use my two swords at all, but I'm almost too clumsy to shoot. But I'm very good at the wall.
14,261,That's right. One of our friends has increased.
14,262,Aquaa seems to be very pleased with him while he smiles with his own smile.
14,263,It's been a long time since I've had a party at my place of work.
14,264,You can't use or use magic one day, you can't use it, you can't use it, you can't use it, you can't use it, you've got a lot of bad luck, you've got a lot of bad luck, and you're still useless.
14,265,During the cabbage hunt, Daquenes and Aqua-A-A-A-A-A-A-N-A-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-N-A-A-N-A-N-A-A-N-A-A-N-A-A-A-N-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-N-A-N-A-A-A-A-N-A-A-A-A-N-N-N-A-N-A-A-A-A-N-A-A-A-N-A-A-N-A-N.
14,266,I don't have any particular reason to say no if I've always been one of my regular associates.
14,267,Because she's beautiful.
14,268,But this dacness. There's hardly any attack at all.
14,269,She's pretty, though.
14,270,It seems that since all the skill points have been put into defense skills, a regular front guard will not be able to master their skills, both hands, and so forth, for a short period of time, to master the skill of the weapon and the ability to handle it better.
14,271,Even though she looks cool, she's a beautiful woman. I can't believe she's alive.
14,272,And they want to jump right into the center of this crane and somehow into a bunch of monsters.
14,273,It may be nice to have the strongest desire to protect the weak and to protect others... but...
14,274,Don't worry about me at this party because I'm the only one who's got a real front job. If you think it's dangerous, you can leave me as a pawn.
14,275,The dacquenes, which are slightly red and wobbly, shake small.
14,276,It's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a... it's a...
14,277,It's a free dom.
14,278,Even though she's such a cool woman, she looks like nothing more than a pervert in my eyes.
14,279,"So, I think it'll be... well, I'm sure you'll be pulling your feet right away, but please don't hesitate to use force and curse me. I'll be happy to help you from now on."
14,280,Every form of recovery is controlled by the arch-sharp, and by the strongest magic, by the arc wizard.
14,281,And there's a crane-sider who's proud of the security of the iron walls.
14,282,That's all I had to say, but I had no idea that I would ever be able to make you suffer.
14,284,5
14,286,The blasphemer's level has risen to six.
14,288,The cabbage hunt will have raised two levels.
14,289,Why does it go up when I just grab a cabbage and I don't even beat it down?
14,290,I wonder why the cabbage has such an experience in the first place.
14,291,There were a lot of places I wanted to pee, but when I thought about it, my head would get hurt, so I'd like to pass.
14,292,In this world, I think if I care about anything, I'll lose.
14,293,It was a reward for 10,000 erys a cabbage, but it's not likely that cabbage gets such a high reward because eating fresh cabbage brings experience.
14,294,In other words, adventurers with money can be strong even if they eat.
14,295,As we went up to the level, our skills points increased.
14,296,I don't care why you're going to have such a phenomenon like roll-playing game when you get to the top of a level, or why you're going to get stuck in it and you're going to lose sleep, so I don't care.
14,297,I'll tell you again and again, but if you care, you'll lose.
14,298,The current skill point is two points.
14,299,I met you at the cabbage hunt, and you taught me your skill with one hand and your first magic skill from the wizard of another party.
14,300,One point to each skill training.
14,301,One-hand sword skills are better at handling one-hand swords as they are called.
14,302,It seems that now I can handle swords as well as people.
14,303,The point was empty again, but I wanted to remember more than the sword and magic.
14,304,There's no one in a world where magic can be used and who doesn't want to use it.
14,305,It seems that first-class magic skills allow us to use simple magic of various attributes of fire, water, soil, and wind.
14,306,By the way, the first attribute magic has a lethal effect on a bunch of people who usually don't take the first grade, save up skills points, and a lot of wizards learn middle-class magic.
14,307,The medium magic uses ten points to master it.
14,308,If you eat such a point, it might be better to give up knowing that I'm not too good at magic and that I'm not so good at shooting and hitting magic.
14,309,It seems that some of them have talent and are born with skills points.
14,310,It's said that good guys who choose higher jobs from the start often have more than 10 or 20 initial skills points.
14,311,On the other hand, Aqua might have been treated fairly well from the beginning, as well as gurneys and dacness.
14,312,The skill point I had from the beginning when I was level one was zero point.
14,313,Let's not think deeply because we're going down.
14,316,I'm learning skills, and I'm starting to look like an adventurer.
14,317,Then I'd like to take care of my gear.
14,318,Sometimes the clothes we bought here can be replaced, but, after all, the dress we're wearing is only a shortsaw to the Jersey where we first wore it.
14,319,It's fine with leather, so I'm going to want one of my good armor.
14,321,That's why I'm here.
14,323,"Why are you even going to go shopping with me?"
14,324,I had come to the armor shop with a complaining Aqua.
14,325,"No, no, no, no, no. I'm a Jersey, and you're just like me, aren't you?"
14,326,Aquaa, like me, will always look like she's been in this world all the time.
14,327,It's like aquamarine's water-colored hair and water-colored eyes are fitted with a finely colored, light - colored color, purpleishish, and shiny, thin - feathered feathers.
14,328,Every day after I changed my clothes to bed while I was dressed, I saw my feathers washed in a room bucket and dried with straw in a dry place where the horse's feed was wiped out.
14,329,(Laughter)
14,330,"Stupid, you seem to forget me, but I'm a goddess, and I'm sure you're also a fetish. Where's my charm with all the state abnormality, with all the power and all the magic in it?"
14,331,I'd like to tell you not to dry such a instrument with horse feed.
14,332,"That's a good thing you heard. If you're in trouble, let's sell your amulets.
14,333,And I said, "Well, you know, I'm going to tell you a story, because this feather is like a sign that I'm a goddess, right?
14,335,6
14,337,It's like, "Well, I don't know, I don't know."
14,338,"Oh, Kazma looks like a good adventurer at last."
14,339,The adventurer Guild, who is no longer in the crowd, saw me and said his thoughts when he saw me dressed up.
14,340,I'd like to ask you if you had ever looked like nothing more than an adventurer, but just a stranger.
14,341,The dress we wear now is made from the top of our clothes in the world, equipped with leather thongs and metal thongs, as well as metal lusciouss.
14,342,I was complained from Aqua, and I was just hanging around in Jersey, that my fantasy was broken, so I bought a few clothes the other day.
14,343,They say it's better to keep one hand free when using magic skills.
14,344,So I've learned magic, even though it's a first grade, so I'm going to put down a single blade of a blade without having a shield, and I'm going to do it in the style of a magic sword.
14,345,The money I received from Chris's stick-up was greatly reduced, but I have enough left to eat for a week or two.
14,346,However, if you still have your equipment and your skills, you will want to go to theques.
14,347,When I tell everyone about it, it nods when Daknes comes up.
14,348,"The Giant-Toad's growth has been well under way, and it's spread all the way to the city's vicinity, so...
14,350,"Let's not frogs!"
14,352,I refused to say anything to Duquenes, but in a strong tone of voice, he said no.
14,353,It's said that frogs are eaten because they sell frogs as food, and they sell frogs as food. But I'm afraid that if you're equipped with something, you're not going to be tempted to hate the metal.
14,354,"Well... they've been eaten by frogs before, so they're devastated. They've been packed from their heads, and they've been covered with fluid, so let's go for the others."
14,355,In my explanation, Daxness somehow blushed a little.
14,356,Pakri from my head.
14,357,"You're not going to be a little excited, are you?"
14,358,I didn't.
14,359,It's starting to worry me a lot.
14,360,He won't go hunting alone if he puts away his eyes, will he?
14,361,"It's the first time I've ever been in this frame of mind, except for the quicksand hunting of cabbages."
14,362,To my opinion, the Dacquenes went looking for a hand-in-the-sized quest for a showpiece.
14,363,And when I hear that, I'm going to tell Aquaa to make a fool of me.
14,364,"That's why the introspective hiccinate... you can see that it's only one of the weakest jobs in the world... but I'm sure I've got more and more advanced careers.
14,365,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
14,366,I don't want to tell you... but I haven't been able to help you yet.
14,367,"What's the matter with you?"
14,368,Aquaa was crazy about my words.
14,369,I'm going to keep going on with it.
14,370,I wouldn't want to be the one who wants you more than that. But at the moment, I'd like to ask you if you're as powerful and powerful as that ability and equipment.
14,371,It's not from her, it's not from her, it's from her, it's from her, she's still a faithful woman...
14,372,I'm going to say it all the time. I'm going to say it all the way up to Aqua, and I'm going to raise my voice even more.
14,373,What's the matter with you? It looks like you've got a lot of catching up with the cabbages, and you've just fallen and crying.
14,374,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
14,375,I'm going to stand at the table and look at the aquamarine, and I'm going to cry, and I'm going to keep going back and forth against what I've been making fun of. I'm going to have a little bit of satisfaction.
14,376,But, as for Aqua, I'm afraid I didn't feel inclined to finish with this.
14,377,He came up from the table and said something cleverly.
14,378,If you've got any ideas, say, "Oh, I'm just doing a good job with my recovery techniques, my recovery magic, my recovery magic, and so on!
14,379,It's like, you know, you're going to look up and you're going to look down and you're going to look down and you're going to look up and you're going to look down and you're going to look up and you're going to look down and you're going to look up and you're going to look up and you're going to look up and you're going to look up at me and you're going to look at me.
14,380,I'll laugh at that aqua.
14,381,"Did you think I wasn't thinking of this kind of thing?"
14,382,Was he a professional gamer?
14,383,I'm just saying that I don't have the strength to be a hero in a story, but I have some knowledge that I grew up in Japan, so I thought I'd make it easy for me to make and try Japanese things for sale in this world. Look, I'm lucky. I was told by my host that if I did it in business, I'd be lucky.
14,384,Well, other Japanese people have the same knowledge, but unlike me, they have special abilities from God.
14,385,I'm sure they're living in a life of commitment, not thinking about business like me.
14,386,What I'm saying is, I'm starting to think adventurers aren't worth it.
14,387,At the moment, I only hunt frogs and cabbages, but if I look at otherques, the results are very low for content.
14,388,I think the price of life in this world is too low.
14,389,After all, in Aquaa's hands, he says what about the magic king, but, to be honest, I don't really get the point of killing him.
14,390,That's why I'm trying to figure out how I can make the easiest living in this world.
14,391,"Well, I'm going to tell you something, and you're going to think about something that's easy to do and you're going to make money, and then you're going to teach me the magic of your last bargain!
14,392,Don't take away the meaning of my existence, because I'm here, you don't have to learn anything!
14,393,I told him that I was lying down on the table, and that if he didn't take away the meaning of my existence at any time, I would start crying.
14,394,And that's how Daxness came back to us.
14,395,A lot of women cry when they're not sure what they're talking about.
14,396,Well, if you're stressed out... it's okay if you spank me instead of Aqua.
14,397,The eyes of both of them are filled with apoias that keep crying on the table.
14,398,Did you realize that you're getting everyone's attention? You cry and then bury your face in the middle of your arm when you're crying. Sometimes it's a little awkward to put your hand around it.
14,399,Don't worry about him. But...
14,400,I saw Dallas as a Chira.
14,401,(Laughter)
14,402,Today's Dukees are tight black skirts and black tank tops and leather boots.
14,403,And to carry a sword on your back in that fashion looks more like a man's sword than a man's sword on his back.
14,404,The other day, when I was hunting cabbage, and I was bagged by a monster, my armor was wearing it, and now I hear I'm going to fix it.
14,405,I had become a respectful person of the thinest dacness I had ever seen.
14,406,The dacness should be tight where it should be, and that's why it's generally dulled.
14,407,As a matter of fact, he's got a sexy body.
14,408,And then you'll be compared to each other, and they'll stand out in the same way that you stand next to each other.
14,409,When it comes to being beautiful and physically good, I've even come to the conclusion that some personality stains are acceptable to break...
14,410,"Did you just say to me, "You're so hot, you're so hot, you're so hot, you're such a bitch?"
14,411,I didn't say.
14,412,Aquaha and Gondo also looked at it as a lyre...
14,413,...no matter how good your face is, your character will still be the most important to you.
14,414,I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
14,415,"Hey, let's hear what it means to look at me now."
14,416,It doesn't make any sense. I just wanted to be happy that I didn't have a locale attribute.
14,417,"The Red Charms are either sold or bought. Let's get out of here."
14,418,I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that.
14,419,"If you're going back and you're going back, why don't you make it possible for the Aqua level to go up?"
14,420,Duquenes said that.
14,421,"What's going on?" "What's going on?" "What's going on?"
14,422,In the case of Aqua, it seems that the skills you need are almost mastered at the initial point, so you don't have to stick to the level up too much.
14,423,"Priests don't come out like warriors, don't defeat their enemies, and don't stop with magic as powerful as wizards. There's no reason for them to believe that the Undead are animists or animists. God's power works against them, and when they are restored, their bodies fall apart."
14,424,Oh, I've heard such a story before.
14,425,Even in most games, it's almost common sense.
14,426,Recovering magic can be used as a weapon for the undead.
14,427,But even if you train this goddess...
14,428,And then I hit it with a flash.
14,429,I had a lot of status when I went up to my level.
14,430,What about Aqua?
14,431,This is a cry on the table, and if the level of the idiot looking at us gets higher and the intelligence gets higher, then it's a lot better.
14,432,"Yeah, it's not that bad. The problem is that the armor of the Dukes has not yet returned..."
14,433,Then Duquenes is able to put his arms together and say good-bye.
14,434,"Well, I'm not specializing on your security skills. Even without your armor, you are more confident than Adamanmeyi. And when you are beaten, you feel better without your armor."
14,435,"You said it was nice to be beaten right now."
14,436,I didn't say.
14,437,I told you.
14,438,I didn't say.
14,439,Duquenes now looks at Aqua with his face still lying on the table.
14,440,"Hey, don't stay up all the time and join us in the conversation.
14,441,I tried to reach out to Aqua and hit him on the shoulder...
14,442,...and I noticed.
14,443,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
14,444,Aqua was crying and tired and sleeping.
14,446,A child or this goddess.
14,448,7
14,450,It's on a hill outside the city.
14,451,There's a cemetery where people who don't have money and who don't have close friends are so buried.
14,452,The way this world is buried is so the soil.
14,453,Just bury it in the ground.
14,454,The quest I received this time was to cut down an undead monster from a common grave.
14,455,The time is about to come in the evening.
14,456,We were now camping around the grave for the night.
14,457,"Hey, Kazma, that's the one I've been keeping my eye on! Here, eat this vegetable!"
14,458,"I don't like vegetables since the cabbage hunts. I'm worried about flying or jumping while I'm cooking."
14,459,A little bit farther from the grave, we'll be ironing and barbecued and waiting for the night.
14,460,Despite the challenge of killing monsters, I didn't take it too long, but this time I did take care of a little monster called a zombie maker.
14,461,It's a kind of evil that tries to manipulate a zombie, and it's going to move itself into a good body and control a few zombies instead of working for them.
14,462,I took it because I said he's a monster who can be defeated even at an opening adventure party.
14,463,This wouldn't be too dangerous even if you had no armor.
14,464,I fill my stomach with coffee powder, water it with the magic of "Create Water," and burn it under the mug as the fire magic of "Tinder."
14,465,It's the first grade magic I've been taught by a wizard who became friends with the cabbage hunt.
14,466,Tierander is the magic used to set the fire as his name says, and he doesn't say clearly about his ability to kill.
14,467,But it's valuable instead of a lighter.
14,468,Seeing me like that, I offered my cup with a look that looked complicated.
14,469,"I'm sorry, but please water me too." Or Katzma is using more legal magic than I do. Although first grade magic is something that few people use, it seems like it's really useful to watch Kazma."
14,470,I'm going to say creation water to the bowl cup.
14,471,"No, I don't think we're going to use it in the first place." That's right. "Create Earth!"
14,472,I took a glimpse of the powdery slassy soil I put out on the flat of my hand.
14,473,There are many attributes of magic in first-class magic, but none of them know how to use it.
14,474,I've been told that... the soil created by that magic, if you use it for fields and so forth, will produce good crops.... That's all.
14,475,When I heard the explanation, Aqua started to blow up next to me.
14,476,"What are you going to do, make Mr. Kazma's field?" "What are you going to do? You're going to turn into a farm! You're going to make soil and you're going to water it with creative water!
14,477,I turned the soil on the level of my right hand towards Aqua and set my left hand.
14,478,"Walring Brits!"
14,479,"Oh, oh, oh, my God! My eyes and my eyes!"
14,480,The soil that was blown off by the wind and the bumps is beating up Aqua's face, and the woman with the dust in her eyes is rolling around the ground.
14,481,It's like, "Well, that's the magic you're using."
14,482,"No, no, no, no, no, I don't usually use it that way!
14,484,8
14,486,It's getting cold, isn't it?
14,487,When the moon rose and the time was around midnight.
14,488,Aqua said such things to me.
14,489,"Oh, don't say that. Don't say that. What if it becomes a flag? I'm going to destroy a zombie maker today, and I'm going to put the pack of zombies back to the earth. And I'm going to go home and sleep in the stable.
14,490,The party members nodded to my words.
14,491,It was about time.
14,492,Chris taught me to put me in the lead with enemy sensory skills, and we walk to the cemetery.
14,493,I'm curious about what Aqua said, but usually this goddess is talking about things that aren't crazy and she won't care much.
14,494,It shouldn't be.
14,495,...and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and....................................... and............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
14,496,"What is it?" "I feel like I'm stuck in the enemy senses. There's two... three or four...?"
14,497,That's a lot, isn't it?
14,498,I've heard that zombies make more than two or three zombies around them.
14,499,At this rate, the error barrier...
14,500,When you think about it, the blue light runs in the middle of the grave.
14,501,What is it?
14,502,It's a magical blue light.
14,503,That blue light, visible in the distance, is a large circle-shaped ghost.
14,504,Next to that magic band, I saw a shadow of a black robe.
14,505,"It's not a zombie maker, it's not... it's not... it's a feeling...
14,506,Megumi lost confidence in herself.
14,507,Around that black robe, I can see a few shadows of yura yura.
14,508,Even if you weren't a zombie maker, you must be an Undead at this time of the year.
14,509,Duquenes is struggling with the big, hard-to-tempering big ass in his chest.
14,510,You calm down.
14,511,At that time, Aqua was acting in a terrible way.
14,512,"Aaah!
14,513,Aquaa stood up for what was going on and ran toward the shadow of the robe.
14,514,Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
14,515,Aa ran out without even asking me to stop, but when she ran into the shadow of the robe, she pointed to the shadow of the person.
14,516,"It's too late for Richie to show up in a place like this! I'm going to fail!"
14,518,Richie.
14,520,It's like a big and dead monster or a vampire, and it's the highest of the undead.
14,521,I'm afraid I'm going to use magic, but I've thrown a man's body away deep behind a magic spell, an undead king called a "no living king."
14,522,Unlike the monster who naturally became an undead because of strong resentment, he is the one who twisted his own own will and became God's adversary.
14,523,You know, like Rasboss, super-big monsters...
14,524,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, who are you?
14,525,"Hey, shut up, you're trying to do something that's a magical magic trick and you're not crazy!
14,526,A super-big monster clung and clung to the back of the gash, crying, holding on to it.
14,529,Richie? The undeads in the circle are staring at each other instead of stopping the two who are in such trouble.
14,530,What should we do?
14,531,In the meantime, I don't think it's a zombie maker.
14,532,Aquas claims to be rich, but somehow Richie seems to be the only child who's being harassed by a hoodlum.
14,533,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
14,534,Richie was right, where did she come from? When something like a blue man and a soul gets into the magic scene all the time, it will be sucked right into heaven with its blue lights.
14,535,Look, I'm not doing that, I'm going to clean this cemetery up!
14,536,(Laughter)
14,537,Aquaa's declaration is in a hurry, Richie.
14,538,Don't worry about it, Aquaa shouts with open arms and with loud voices.
14,539,Turn-an-dead!
14,540,The whole grave was wrapped in white light around Aqua.
14,541,The light that fills the air as it bubbles out of the Aqua is as soon as it touches the zombies of Richie's band, it causes them to disappear so that they can disappear.
14,542,Even the souls of Richie's people who were gathered on the magic band didn't get the light from Aqua.
14,543,That light, as well as Richie...
14,544,"Oh, my body's gone! Stop it! I'm going to lose my body!"
14,545,"Aaah-ha-ha-ha-ha! A being that is contrary to the laws of nature, an Undead, disobedient to the will of God!
14,546,"Hey, don't do that."
14,547,I was standing behind the Aqua, and I bit the back of my head with a sword handle.
14,548,"What are you doing?"
14,549,When I hit my back on my head, my focus went fast. Stop shooting white lights and hold my head down while I'm eating me with my eyes full of tears.
14,550,Duquenes and his wife had gone through all of this, and I ignored the clenched aquamarine and called out to Richie, who was trembling.
14,551,(Laughter)
14,552,When I look at Richie's feet, they're all half full of light crystal and disappear lightly.
14,553,In time, she gradually returned until she saw clearly her translucent feet and, with tears in her eyes, Richie stood up.
14,554,I'm Richie, you're right. I'm Richie.
14,555,When I put up the hood that had been wearing on the bottom of my eye, it appeared that it was a brown - haired beauty that was seen only by a 20-year-old human.
14,556,I've always imagined that Richie would be like a skeleton.
14,557,Wiz wraps himself in a black robe and looks like an evil wizard.
14,558,No. Richie's a bad wizard?
14,559,What are you doing in a grave like this?
14,560,And I said, "Well, you know, if you're like, "Hey, Kazma, if you're like a rotten dog, if you talk like that, you're going to have an undead move on to you!
14,561,You're so full of Aquaa's words that you're trying to trick Wiz.
14,562,I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do.
14,563,"Well, as you can see, I'm doing Richie, No Life King, so I can hear the stories of lost souls, since so many of the souls in this cemetery don't even have the money to bury them in the grave, and they hide them every night without going back to heaven. So, as an Andean king, I regularly visit here and send back to heaven those who have returned to heaven."
14,564,It's... it's warm.
14,565,She's a good person.
14,566,Probably a decent person I've met in this world for the first time, except for the shop clerk and so on.
14,567,No, it's not human.
14,568,"I think it's a good thing, and I think it's a good thing... but I don't think it's a good thing.
14,569,My question was, how could I be so concerned about the ever- so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-so-called ame that Wiz would say it to me?
14,570,"Well, the people in this town, the people who don't have money, say, "Well, you know, the people in this town, the people who don't have money, they'll come back later..."
14,571,It's probably hard to say because there's an Aquamarst aquamarine.
14,572,So, you're saying, "Well, I don't know if this town's stampes are making money anymore, but most of these money-first guys are buried in a cemetery like this.
14,573,It's like, "What are you talking about?"
14,574,As the silent gaze of everyone present gathers in Aquaa, the person who is present turns away from the evil look.
14,575,"Well then, that's too bad, but isn't it a good idea to summon a zombie? We're here because we were asked to cut down a zombie maker."
14,576,To my words, Wiz looked in trouble.
14,577,I don't know... but when I come here, the corpse still in shape will respond so well to my magic... and I would, for my part, if those who are buried in this grave were to return to heaven, there would be no reason to come here... well, let's see.
14,579,9
14,581,The way home from the grave.
14,582,"It's not worth it!"
14,583,Aqua was still angry.
14,584,It's already time for the sky to turn white.
14,585,"I can't help it. I don't think I'll ever feel like killing such a good man."
14,586,We decided to miss that Richie.
14,587,And from now on, the fact that Aqua is so busy every day that he regularly goes to clean up that tomb makes sense.
14,588,It seems to me that it's my job to clean up the dead and the lost souls.
14,589,I've been trying to get some sleep, but I've always tried to get some sleep.
14,590,In an effort to escape the monsters, there were young loggers and Daxnes, and they knew that Wiz had never attacked anyone, and they agreed to let Wiz go.
14,591,I wander around looking at a piece of paper passed by the Wiz.
14,592,"But what about the security of this city?"
14,593,It's a piece of paper with the address where Wiz lives.
14,594,That Richie seems to live normally in the town where we live.
14,595,And I hear you own a small magic item store.
14,596,When I told him that Richie had a deep image of Danjon, he didn't have to go to all the trouble of living with him.
14,597,No, Richie is human, so I understand what you're saying.
14,598,I know, but since I came to this world, the alien worldview I've had has been breaking down a lot.
14,599,This isn't the world I expected.
14,600,"But I'm glad I didn't have to go to the trouble of being in a good mood." But even if I told you I'd been in a good mood, it was Richie. If it wasn't for the fight, I and Kazoma wouldn't have died as soon as I did."
14,601,I'm amazed at the casual words of a man who doesn't know what to do.
14,602,"What's so dangerous about Richie?"
14,603,"It's not a bad idea. Richie's aim is not to prevent powerful magic, and to disable attacks on non-malicious weapons, which can cause various conditions just by touching the other person, and the legendary undead monster that absorbs the magic and life force."
14,604,I feel like I'm going to be underprivileged lightly.
14,605,You're right. It's like taking care of an undead monster.
14,606,I was happy to get a card because you said you'd teach me Richie's skills... but I'll always take Aqua when I go to school.
14,607,"Cazma, give me the card you got. I'll go home before that woman, and I'll be in the middle of a holy circle around the house, and I'll cry."
14,608,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
14,609,Maybe you shouldn't take Aquaa with you after all...
14,610,When I was thinking about it, Daxness said to me, "I'm going to take care of you."
14,611,And I said, "Well, what's going to happen to the zombie maker's quest to kill him?"

14,614,I'm sorry, I didn't take any chances.
15,4,1
15,6,"Do you know that one of the top members of the King's Custer Army has taken over an old castle on a hill just up the hill from the city?"
15,7,The part of a conjoined liquor store on Gild.
15,8,I've been drinking wine since noon, and I've been listening to a man sitting in the hall.
15,9,As for me, I'm not drinking, but I'm drinking a neoid chaschaschais face to face with a man.
15,10,What's a neoid?
15,11,What is shawashawa?
15,12,People who don't drink much drink often drink this, so I've been really interested in it...
15,13,If you're asked if it's delicious, we have to answer:
15,14,I don't know.
15,15,But now I know what Shawawa means.
15,16,After drinking, I get nervous.
15,17,But it's not carbonic acid. I don't even know what that means, but I can only describe it as shachascha.
15,18,I'll drink and put the neoid on the dry table...
15,19,"He's the head of the Demon King." That's a noisy story, but it's nothing we can do about it, isn't it?"
15,20,"It doesn't make any difference."
15,21,The man in front of me laughed at my unintended and irresponsible words and agreed.
15,22,I'm surprised many of those who speak out in the gild with the sleazy blasphemers, and there's a lot of white-and-white stories to listen to.
15,23,I don't know where I saw dangerous monsters, so I'd better not take any ventures around there for a while.
15,24,That monster doesn't smell like he doesn't like it when he puts it on his body.
15,25,I mean, I've never collected this information since I came to this world.
15,26,Information collecting is the most important flag collection operation in the game.
15,27,These meetings at the bar are just like adventurers and nice places.
15,28,The adventurer man across the street said.
15,29,"Well, whatever it is, don't go near the edge of the city. You shouldn't go near the ruins of the castle.
15,32,I sat down and thanked the man, and I went to the table at our party...
15,33,Look at me, look at me with such weird eyes.
15,34,Aquaa, Daquenes, and Gonzalez placed them in the middle of the table. They bit me with a glass of vegetable sticks.
15,35,"No, I don't care if Kazma's going to join any other party."
15,36,Aqua might say it, but with a little anxious eyes I'm going to go check it out.
15,37,"Well, I'm sure information collection is the basis of adventure."
15,38,I sit at the table with three people and reach for a vegetable stick to get me one too.
15,39,Oh, my God.
15,40,A vegetable stick slipped away from my extended hand.
15,41,Hey.
15,42,What are you doing?
15,43,When an Aqua hits the table in a van, the vegetable stick jumps off.
15,44,Aquaa will carry a vegetable stick that has not moved at all when it's not moving.
15,45,It looks like you've had fun. You and the other members of the party have been quite friendly, haven't you?
15,46,Megumi grabbed her fist and knocked on the table and carried a vegetable stick to her mouth that she had put in a fight.
15,47,"What's this new feeling?" "What's this new feeling?"
15,48,A pervert who can't help but talk funny things, twists a cup's fist with pins and fingers, and picks a vegetable stick with his finger.
15,49,"What's wrong with you guys? I don't know if collecting information in places like this is basic...?"
15,50,As I said, when I hit a van and table, I put my hand on a vegetable stick...
15,51,That's right.
15,52,I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
15,53,"No, no, no, no! What are you doing to my vegetable stick?
15,54,I put a vegetable stick on my hand and it's a bad hand, and now when I put a cup with a stick in it, I'm going to hit it against the wall, but I'm going to put my hand on a half tears ache.
15,55,"You can't take care of yourself when you're a vegetable sticker! You can't just jump in and out of it! Why are the vegetables running for their lives?"
15,56,"What are you talking about? You don't have fish, you don't have vegetables, you don't have anything fresh, it's better to be fresh, isn't it?"
15,57,I don't know if I've ever made such a living.
15,58,I give up eating vegetable sticks.
15,59,"Oh, well, I don't care about vegetables anymore, but I've got more questions for you than that. If you get up, I'll try to figure out what skills you'll learn next.
15,60,Well, if you're going to perform your quest efficiently, you'd better learn how to deal with the members of the party.
15,61,That's why I asked for advice.
15,62,"I've got a lot of physical self-restraint and legal tolerance and a lot of different state-resistant skills."
15,63,"What are you going to do?" "What are you going to do?" "What are you going to do?"
15,64,"No, but I've got strength and strength. If the attack is easily hit, then it's not like I'm going to be able to knock down a monster without a scratch. It's not like I'm going to be forced to hit a monster by force....
15,65,"That's enough. You shut up."
15,66,Don't tell me what you're doing.
15,67,I'll leave the dacquenes in red and the dachnes I'm talking about.
15,68,When I looked around, I leaned my neck and opened my mouth.
15,69,"I'm, of course, an explosive skill.
15,70,"What's wrong with you? Are you going to take medium magic skills?"
15,71,No.
15,72,This guy's got a bad eye...
15,73,Well, I'm...
15,74,You're okay.
15,75,"What?"
15,76,I tried to say my skills, so I silenced Aqua.
15,77,I'm sure it'll be nice to meet you at a banquet or a party or party or something like that.
15,78,But...
15,79,"Why is this party so uncomplicated?"
15,80,"What?"
15,81,My little dandelion and dandelion made three of them look like dassies.
15,83,2
15,85,That's the quickest cabbage I've ever seen. It's been a few days since I started hunting.
15,86,At that time, those cabbages that I had collected were sold in a row.
15,87,And the adventurers were paid more than that.
15,88,"Look, Kazma, the reward was good, so I added a little more armor to the suit I had asked you to fix it."
15,89,By adventurers trying to get paid, he showed them the armor that Daknes returned from the repairs in the terrible crowded gilds.
15,90,It's just, in one word...
15,91,It's like, "It's like an armor with a nobleman's tank in it."
15,92,I'd like to get a compliment from the mendings.
15,93,Duquenes is going to say it with a strange, a little grumpy face.
15,94,I don't know. It's like that.
15,95,It's better than that.
15,96,"There are worse ones now than you, so I don't have much time to care about them."
15,97,"Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh... oh, that's so great!
15,98,He was holding his new cane in his arms.
15,99,It seems that a rare metal, such as manatee, has the properties that when mixed with a cane, the magic and powerful might improve.
15,100,With a high reward, we can strengthen the staff, and the chrysanthemum has been this way since morning.
15,101,It seems that this will increase the power of anything.
15,102,There are a lot of things to say, but I don't want to have too much to do with the present soap.
15,103,I've already lost my cash balance and I'm a clown too.
15,104,The dacnes that lured the monsters after the cabbage.
15,105,It's a powdered bowl with a bunch of them.
15,106,Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
15,107,The rewards received in cabbage hunting were not divided equally, but each of them decided to make up for what they caught on their own.
15,108,That's what Aqua said next to me.
15,109,And now I'm waiting for the money to come up...
15,110,"What's wrong with you?"
15,111,Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-th-a-a-th-a-a-th-a-th-a-th-a-th-a-th- a- b-b-a-th- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b.
15,112,I don't like it.
15,113,At Gild's reception counter, the plan-making Aquaa was also in trouble.
15,114,Gild's older sister's chest is squirming, and she's doing something about it.
15,115,I'm like, "Why do you think I got 50 grand?
15,116,"It's hard to say, but..."
15,117,"What the fuck?"
15,118,It's like, "Oh, Mr. Aqua, I've caught most of them with lettuce."
15,119,I'm like, "What are you doing here?"
15,120,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
15,121,It seems to me that to hear the conversation, it wasn't worth the reward.
15,122,Did you think it was nothing to tell the receptionist any more? Aquaa put her hand behind her back, and her smile came up to me with a smile.
15,123,"Mr. Kazma, how much do you pay for this quest?"
15,124,A million little ones.
15,125,"What?"
15,126,Aqua and Daquenes, I have a crush on you.
15,127,That's right. I fell down and burst into a burst of quest and suddenly became a rich little man.
15,128,I heard that what I harvested was good quality and that there were a lot of cabbages full of experience.
15,129,Is this also the difference in luck?
15,130,"Cazma! I've been thinking about it for a long time, but you feel really good there!"
15,131,"If you don't remember where to praise me specifically, don't mind. I'll tell you, I've already decided to use this money, and I won't share it."
15,132,My first words frozen Aqua's smile.
15,133,I've been spending all the money I've had in the last few days and it's coming in and it's almost a hundred thousand dollars!
15,134,I put my finger on a half-supposed apothecary, and asked why he wouldn't think about it later.
15,135,"I don't know, but you're the one who said, "Let each one keep his reward."
15,136,Normally, a sleazy person doesn't have a house.
15,137,Because adventurers often fly around without looking for stability.
15,138,Well, it's one of the reasons why most adventurers don't have a lot of money in their daily lives, except for the successful adventurers.
15,139,To tell you the truth, I'm giving up on the fact that I can't stand a king who's going to cut down on this man.
15,140,The work of fighting the Demons should be done by those who have been sent here first and have been given powerful equipment.
15,141,After all, I'm an early profession and the youngest adventurer who can become anyone.
15,142,Moreover, compared to the kind of people I've been training for adventures since childhood, they're less stable, and they're just one of the most common people in the world.
15,143,You have enough adventures to satisfy your sense of security and sense of humor, and you can live at ease in the rest of your life.
15,144,That's why I thought we couldn't get one of the rents that we want here, or the rent that we want, or the cheap thing that looks like a small hut. That's the first thing.
15,145,I want an aqua. I feel like I'm going to cry.
15,146,"Oh, my God, please lend me enough money! I just need enough money to pay for it! I know it's just a boy, and I'm in a stable, and I'm in the middle of the night, so I know I want a private space!
15,147,I'm like, "Okay, okay, 50 or 100,000 is cheap! OK, shut up!"
15,149,3
15,151,"Let's go quickly," he said, "Cuzma, we're going fast!
15,152,Suddenly, Akira made such a statement.
15,153,Hmm.
15,154,"Well, I'm also a zombie maker, and I didn't have time to test my new skills in the end.
15,155,And I said, "No, let's do a quest to make money!
15,156,"No, this place should be hit by a strong enemy!
15,157,There will be so many of them that there will be no unity.
15,158,"Well, let's see if we can figure this out."
15,159,In my opinion, everyone's going to move to Zorozoro and the notice board.
15,160,And...
15,161,I'm like, "What's wrong with you?"
15,162,Well, usually it's a small area and a large amount of requested paper.
15,163,That's only a few pieces now.
15,164,And...
15,165,"Cazma, let's do this!
15,166,I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
15,167,Well, all that's left is too much for us now.
15,168,Guild staff came to see us like that.
15,169,"Well, I'm sorry, but I've recently been living in a castle near the city...
15,170,The penniless Aquaa screamed at the words of the sorry staff.
15,171,"What's wrong with you?"
15,172,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
15,175,"Oh, my God, why are you moving around at this time of year?
15,176,Aquaa was crying with her eyes full of tears, and she was so stupid that she turned over a part-time magazine.
15,177,All the other adventurers seem to have the same mind, and more people usually drink from the daytime than they can do.
15,178,What on earth did the leader of the evil king come to this place?
15,179,To make it clear, the adventurers in this city are not so different from us.
15,180,There are, of course, many more adventure parties than we do, but we know what we did.
15,182,This is the city where adventurers come first and first, and where they go for beginners.
15,183,A leader of a demon king comes out in the game, as it were, of a Rast.
15,184,No matter how many of us who fight against frogs, we won't even win.
15,186,4
15,188,I mean, you can't do a decent job until next month, when the best adventurers and knights come here from the capital of the country.
15,189,"That's right... and I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to go out with me for a while while I'm gone."
15,190,I went out of town with Ha Ni.
15,191,At present, there are no dangerous monsters near the city.
15,192,Because of the advent of the evil lord's leadership, the weak monster is hiding in terror.
15,193,I was taking a walk in the company of all the people I've been working with who's not going to be able to shoot a bomb or shoot a bomb because they're not going to be able to do anything about it.
15,194,It seems that this guy makes a daily routine of blowing up explosives once a day.
15,195,Do you think I'm going to be seeing this every day or until next month?
15,196,If I let him go alone, he would open the door and ask who would take me home with him.
15,197,It's okay if you're around. Let's just get some magic shots out of here.
15,198,A short distance out of town, I urged her not to cast a spell on her.
15,199,But it's just that I shake my neck.
15,200,"It's my eye." "It's my eye." "It's not far from the city. I'll be scolded only by the guards."
15,201,"You just said it again. Did you get angry because of the noise and the confusion?"
15,202,My words nod my throat.
15,203,I can't help it. I'm very shy and a little nervous, but there are no monsters anyway.
15,204,Once in a while, I decided to take a trip.
15,206,After all, since I came to this world, I didn't often hang out like this.
15,207,Even if you walk out, it's all about the quest to kill monsters.
15,208,It's not like taking a walk in peace...
15,209,What is that?
15,210,Far away, on a hill.
15,211,There's an old castle that's fallen to pieces.
15,212,It's like a haunted rug...
15,213,"It's so bad, it's so thin... it's like living in a ghost."
15,214,I don't know what I'm talking about.
15,215,And I said, "Well, what do you think of that?"
15,216,With that said, I'm going to start preparing my magic and uki.
15,217,Wherever you are, on the hill where the nice wind blows.
15,218,It's different in the quiet atmosphere, and the explosion of magic in the wind...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15,221,...this is how the new daily routine of Yoichi and I began.
15,222,There's no money in Aquaa, but every day I'm rooting for a part-time job.
15,223,Duquenes said he'd be working at his parents' place for a while.
15,224,In particular, the unskilled bowl kept going by that abandoned castle every day, releasing explosive magic.
15,225,That's the evening when it's cold and wet and ice.
15,226,It goes down after a calm meal after noon.
15,227,It's early in the morning at a refreshing walk.
15,228,At any given time, Akira casts magic into its ruins every day...
15,229,I kept looking at magic by the side of Megumi until I knew what the bomb was doing that day.
15,230,"Explor John!"
15,231,"Hey, today's bomb blast is going to be a good thing, but it's going to be a good thing, and it's going to be a good thing, and it's going to be a little bit late, as if it's going to be a rough shot, as if it's going to pass through the sand and the bone, and it's going to be a little bit late to keep the air in motion as if it's going to rub its skin.
15,232,Today's assessment was a poet. &gt;&gt;What do you think? &gt;&gt;It's not like Kazma is going to talk to you. &gt;&gt;Just think about it. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt;&gt;It's okay. &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I think. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I's fun. &gt;gt;gt;gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So.
15,233,"Well, I don't know if it's going to happen, but it's going to be fun to learn how to use it as a party arrangement. But if you're good enough to do it or retire, it's going to be fun at last to learn how to do it."
15,234,Momo and I laugh at each other while saying such things.
15,235,Today's explosion of magic was significant. No, it was small, but it sounded good, and we talked about it.
15,237,5
15,239,I continued my daily bombing walk, and a week later, that morning.
15,240,All adventurers, gather at the front gate of the city, armed and ready to fight!
15,241,All over the city, an urgent announcement of my uncle's handsome appearance sounded like an emergency announcement.
15,242,When we hear the announcement, we're going to the scene with our gear and we're on our way.
15,243,As many adventurers gathered in front of the city's front gate, we stood before the monster, who made a tremendous deal of pressure.
15,245,Durahan.
15,247,It sentences a man to death and gives him a headless knight in despair.
15,248,A monster who became an Undead and who had the special ability to be a body that transcended life before it was born.
15,250,The knight, with his thick, dark, oak armor standing in front of the main gate, held his head on the left side and held it over his head while adventurers all over the city watched and held out their heads covered with full face and helmets.
15,251,From the neck that was offered to me, there's a shrill sound.
15,252,"I'm a member of a high-ranking evil army who recently moved into a castle near here."
15,253,In time, her neck began to shake with a pluripot...!!!!!!!!!!!!!
15,254,I'm like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
15,255,The leader of the demon king was already a little angry.
15,258,Durahan's roar, like he's been enduring something for a long time, but he's finally worn out, caused the adventurers around me to scream.
15,259,I mean, no one in the room has caught up with what's going on.
15,260,In the meantime, it seemed that our sudden call was due to a mad Durahan in front of us.
15,261,It's like, "What's wrong with you?"
15,262,"If I say I'm the guy who can use the blasting magic..."
15,263,"When I say "exploding magic..."
15,264,There was a natural eye to stand next to me.
15,265,...with eyes turned around, the chrysanthemum saw a wizard girl next to her.
15,266,And when I see him, everyone around me will be caught, and I'll keep an eye on him...
15,267,"What!" he said, "Why are you looking at me?
15,268,A girl of a wizard who is in a hurry to be stripped of her unstinting, unstinting clothes.
15,269,That abandoned castle that was magical every day!
15,270,That was...
15,271,When I glanced into the next room, I found that the chrysanthemum was cool and sweaty.
15,272,Apparently, he's noticed too.
15,273,In time, Akira sighed and came forward with a nasty look on her face.
15,274,And as a matter of fact, adventurers will clear the way for Durahan.
15,275,Durahan, in front of the city's main gate.
15,276,I wanted to be about ten meters away from that Durahan.
15,277,I started with you and followed you after the dacnes and aquamas.
15,278,When I found Unidad, I saw what happened with Aquahan, as if it were an enemy of my parents, and how seldom, so often, was the angry Durahan so often, and how often it was made to taste good.
15,279,If you know that I'm an evil lord and I'm selling ogres, why do you shake in the city? I know that there are only low-level adventurers in this city!
15,280,How the day-to-day blast magic responded! Durahan's helmet trembled with rage.
15,281,He was so overwhelmed by the boulders, he was so frightened by the wind, he was so scared by the wind, he was so scared by the wind, he was so scared by the wind, he was so scared by the wind, he was so scared by the seams of his shoulders...
15,282,"My name is ARC wizard, and I'm the one who manipulates the blasting magic..."
15,283,"What do you mean... what do you mean, "What are you making fun of me?"
15,284,"Hey, that's different!"
15,285,I was hit by the well-known Durahan, but when I got over it, I thought I'd get over it.
15,286,"I'm a Red Witch, and I've always been a great wizard in this city. It was a plan to lure you out of the Army of Magic...
15,287,As I watched behind me at Durahan with my staff, I whispered in a whisper to the Dukeness and the Aqua.
15,288,He said, "Hey, hey, he's saying that if you don't blow up every day, you'll die. So when did you have to take him near that castle?
15,289,He's like, "Oh, well, you're the best wizard in town."
15,290,I don't have to blow up on you today, and I've got a lot of adventurers holding back, so I'm good right now, so keep your eyes open!
15,291,Did you hear our whispers?
15,292,Speaking of Durahan, for some reason it's as good a place as it should be.
15,293,You're a... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
15,294,"Hey, if you have a problem with my parents' name, why don't you ask me?"
15,295,I tried to heat up Durahan's words, but I don't know what he's talking about.
15,296,In other words, when you see a crowd of adventurers all over the city, you don't show any signs of concern.
15,297,I don't think there's any high-ranking member of the Sakura King or any of our little children.
15,298,I didn't come here to hang out with you little fish. I've come here to investigate. I'm sure you'll want to stay in that castle for a while, but from now on, don't use explosive magic, okay?
15,299,"It's as good as telling me to die, but the Red Charms will die if they don't blow up magic once a day."
15,300,"Hey, hey, I've never heard of such a thing!
15,301,What should I do? I'm starting to feel like watching out for that monster.
15,302,When I look at it, I'm excited and excited to see the gurney hanging over Durahan.
15,303,Durahan put his neck on top of his right hand and showed it with his hands and his shoulders.
15,304,"What do you think you're going to do to stop me from shooting a bomb?" I'm the one who fell into the trap, but I'm the one who used to wear a sword. There's no taste for the weak. But if you're going to get lost in the neighborhood of the castle, do you have any idea?"
15,305,It's a sword-sharp look on the part of Durahan, who's letting go, and he's holding back.
15,307,But when I wake up in the face of an unsurpassed smile...
15,309,"It's us who are so confused and confused, because you're sitting in that castle, we can't afford to be able to afford it.
15,310,After he had cut off the large seams, he threw them in the aqua.
15,311,Hey.
15,312,"Oh, I don't know if I'm the head of the Witch King, but it's bad luck to be here when I'm here. It's like you're telling me that if you're an undead that you're going to come out in such a light that you're weak, you're going to have to clean it up!
15,313,The rejected teacher, Aquaa, appeared before Durahan in spite of all the effort.
15,314,As they watched, they watched as Aquaa thrust her hand out to Durahan.
15,315,Durahan, who saw it, enthusiastically turned his neck forward to Aquaa.
15,316,I think this is going to be the way to look at Durahan's or really serious.
15,317,"Well, this is not a stamp, this is an arc stamp?" I wasn't even close enough to be cleaned up by a low level of arc pressing in a city like this.
15,318,Durahan put his index finger on his left hand to the screen before Aquaa tried to sing the magic.
15,319,And Durahan shouts!
15,320,"Declare thee death! You shall die in a week!"
15,321,It was at the same time that Durahan put on a curse, and the Dukes were necked and collared and hid behind them.
15,322,"What's going on?"
15,323,During the shouting, the body of Daknes glows slightly black when the blink of an eye.
15,324,Damn it, I got you, I'm on death row!
15,325,"Do you have any pain?"
15,326,When I'm in a hurry to ask, Daxness grabs on several times as if he's holding his hands tightly.
15,327,"Well, I don't think so."
15,328,She said she didn't worry after all.
15,329,But Durahan did scream.
15,330,He said he'd die in a week.
15,331,Durahan says he's won and proud while Aquaines, who has been cursed.
15,332,"The curse is not at all wrong now, but it's going to be better for the adventurers, who are close to each other's unions, but... well, if it's the daughter of the Red Shah, then it's going to die a week later. &gt;&lt;i&gt;Kell, your dear friends will be scared and troubled by the fear of death before that... &lt;i&gt;That's because of what you've done! &lt;i&gt;It's because of what you've done! &lt;i&gt;It's better for you to feel sorry for the way you've done. &lt;i&gt;It's better for me to hear what you did.&lt;/i&lt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&lt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&i&gt;i&i&i&i&i&i&i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&i&gt;i&gt;i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&i&i&gt;i&gt;i&gt;i&i&gt;i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i&i:
15,333,As Durahan's words turned pale, Daqnes shouted his war cry.
15,335,"Oh, my God, you're asking me to put a death curse on you and do what I say if you want me to do it and you want me to do it!
15,337,"What?"
15,339,Durahan, who couldn't understand what Duquenes said, gave it back with his bare hands.
15,340,I can't understand what I'm saying as well. I don't want to.
15,341,I'm not going to give in to the curse... but I'm not going to give in!
15,342,In front of the public, the pathetic Durahan, who was called a very violent pervert, said, "I don't know what I'm talking about."
15,343,"What?"
15,344,I'm sorry.
15,345,Don't think my body can be controlled, but don't think I'll be able to be free to the heart!
15,346,"What?"
15,347,"Don't go, don't go! Durahan's people are in trouble!"
15,348,D'Aknes, who tried to follow the enemy with a Nococo, was held back by the exchange, and we saw Durahan feeling relieved.
15,349,"And if you do this, then stop blowing off my castle, daughter of the Reds! And if you want me to break the curse of the Klasider there, come to my castle! If you can come to my room on the top floor of the castle, I'll open it! ... but my undead men under my command are on my side!
15,350,Durahan said so, laughing and laughing and riding on a headless horse parked outside the city and then leaving for the castle...
15,352,6
15,354,More or less, the adventurers who had been gathered to such a great extent stood all the way up.
15,355,That's the same thing with me.
15,356,Next to me, I'm going to start over by shaking my blue face and holding my cane.
15,357,And he tries to get out of town alone.
15,358,"Hey, where are you going?" "What are you going to do?"
15,359,When I pull the cape of a mango, he'll push his legs hard, but he won't turn around, and he'll say it.
15,360,"This is my responsibility. I'll go up to the castle and throw a bomb directly into that Durahan, and make Durahan clear the curse of Duquenes."
15,361,If I went alone, there wouldn't be any consequences.
15,362,I don't know.
15,363,"I'm sure I'm going to go, too, but if you're alone, you're going to use magic against the fish, and that's what I'm going to do. You're such an idiot who didn't even know it was a top-up castle."
15,364,With a bitter look on his face on my face for a while, he soon dropped his shoulders as if he had given up on me.
15,365,So... do you want to go with him? But he's told me the Undead Night is beating him. When it comes to it, the weapons will be harder to use. My magic should be more effective.
15,366,She said that she had a smile on her face.
15,367,It's called an undead night, so it's probably someone in good armor.
15,368,When I'm dealing with something like that, I'll suddenly become helpless, having only a cheap sword.
15,369,But then I had an idea.
15,370,"Let's go in and out of the castle with my enemy-sensitivity skills, peering into the monsters in the castle and hiding them under the cover of the ground. Or we'll go through the castle every day, and we'll go through the castle, and we'll come back and we'll tear them down on the ground every day. - If you have a week's time, you can do that."
15,371,Did I have any hope for my proposal? I nodded with a bright look on my face.
15,372,When I look back at Daknes, my girlfriend and I...
15,373,"Hey, Duquenes, I'm going to do something about the curse!
15,374,Sayid Break spell!
15,375,I'm in the middle of making a voice to cheer up Duquenes.
15,376,With Aqua's spell in its way to block it out, the body of Daquenes glowed faintly.
15,377,And in contrast to the blithe, sad dacness, I've been talking about it a lot.
15,378,"It's easy for me to break the curse of Durahan! What do you think?
15,381,"What?"
15,383,. . . . . .
15,385,7
15,387,One day a week passed before the attack of a leader of a demon king.
15,389,And I said, "Well, I'm going to ask you a question."
15,391,"What..."
15,392,All of a sudden, the voice of discontent between me and Aka broke out at the same time.
15,393,Except for the aqua, our bosoms are rich.
15,394,I don't want to go out of my way to work now that there's only a high degree of difficulty.
15,395,"I don't mind... but Aqua and I will be short of fire..."
15,396,Duquenes looks over there and over there with me.
15,397,Even if you look at me like that, you don't have to force me to accept a dangerous quest.
15,398,Look at us when we don't want to. It's okay. Aquaa started crying.
15,399,"Oh, please, please, I don't want to work all the time, because the manager gets angry when the cologne lasts, because I'm going to do my best!"
15,400,Me and Zinji look at each other.
15,401,"I can't help it." "Well, then, I think it's going to be a little better. Come and find the Challenge. I'll follow you if it's not bad."
15,402,In those words, Aqua would rush to and fro in the face of the challenge board.
15,403,"Why don't you go see what's going on?" "Why don't you go see what's going on?"
15,404,"Well, well, I don't have to complain about my silly quest, but..."
15,405,After listening to Daxness's opinion, I had a bad feeling about it too.
15,406,When I go to a notice board where the challenge is being put out, I stand behind Aqua, which has a taste of the challenge I'm going to carry with me in this difficult face.
15,407,Aqua is not aware of me standing behind him, and he's choosing theque with a serious face.
15,408,In time, a piece of paper was picked up from the board and picked up by hand.
15,409,Okay.
15,410,I'm like, "What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you?"
15,411,If I had Aquaa, I would've taken the written and written books.
15,413,There are places where Manticore and Glyphons are fighting a massive struggle between manticores and glyphos. It's very dangerous to leave them alone, so if you leave them alone, put them all together and destroy them.
15,415,You're an idiot!
15,416,When I cried out, I put the paper back into its original place.
15,417,It was the right thing to come and see. I almost got caught up in a terrible quest.
15,418,"What's the matter with two birds when they're together, when they're in the middle of a fireball, they're not one shot at a time."
15,419,I wonder how he's going to throw it at me when it comes to his plan to bring together two dangerous monsters in a convenient manner.
15,420,I was worried that I would ask for a start there and send it out alone. Aquaa was so excited that she pulled her sleeves off her clothes.
15,421,"Hey, look at this! Look at this!"
15,422,He told me to look at the application that Aqua points to.
15,423,I'd like to ask you to clean the water because it's bad water, one of the city's water sources, and the blue alligators have started to live in it. Once the lake is cleansed, monsters need to move their habitat elsewhere, not destroy monsters.
15,424,(Laughter)
15,425,Aquaa laughs with her nose on my question.
15,426,"Who do you think I am, you idiot? Who do you think I am?"
15,427,"You're the god of the feast, aren't you?"
15,428,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
15,429,I see.
15,430,Just purifying the water is like three hundred thousand. It certainly tastes good.
15,431,The point is very high that you don't have to cut down.
15,432,And I said, "Well, why don't you just clean it up and you can take the reward for yourself?"
15,433,But I'm afraid of what I'm saying.
15,434,"Well, maybe when you're cleaning up the lake, the monsters will come to your door, and I'd like you to protect me from the monsters until I finish cleaning up."
15,435,That's what I'm talking about.
15,436,But he's a blue-targeter, and he's a crocodile monster, according to his name, isn't he?
15,437,It looks very dangerous, but...
15,438,"How long will it take you to clean your face?" "How long will it take?"
15,439,If it ends in a short period of time, I'll be able to manage with the explosion magic of the broom.
15,440,Aquaa leaned over her neck and said,
15,441,"A half a day or so?"
15,442,"You're such a long way from home."
15,443,I can't defend myself for half a day against a dangerous monster by name.
15,444,I was trying to get the paper back...
15,445,"Oh, please, please, please, there is no other challenge!
15,446,I thought to Aquaa when I was about to put a piece of paper back on the notice board and leaned my arm to the right and cried.
15,447,And I said, "Well, how do you do that?"
15,448,"What do you want to do?" "What do you want to do?" "What do you want to do?" "What do you want to do?"
15,449,I see. Should I touch the water?
15,450,I had an idea, but then...
15,451,No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
15,452,"Hey, Aqua. Maybe there's a safe way to clean up. Would you like to try it?"
15,454,8
15,456,It's a big lake a little away from the city.
15,457,The lake, which has been considered one of the water sources of the city, contains a small stream that leads to the city.
15,458,There was a mountain near the lake, and from there it was constantly flowing into it.
15,459,I see.
15,460,As I was asked to do, the water in the lake was clouded and swollen.
15,461,I thought monsters would like clean water, but isn't it?
15,462,When I'm looking at the lake, I hear a quiet voice coming from behind.
15,463,"Are you really going to do this?"
15,464,That's a very nervous Aqua voice.
15,465,What's bothering me about my simple plan?
15,467,Aquaa said.
15,468,"I feel like a little monster that's been sold and caught."
15,469,...in the middle of a steel ore with rare monsters locked in.
15,471,Take the aqua in the ore and drop it into the lake.
15,472,At first, I thought I'd get him to clean out of a safe ore near the lake, but he said the purifying spell couldn't be used unless it touched water.
15,473,It seems that Aqua, the goddess of water, doesn't dip in water for a day at the bottom of the lake, but sinks in the bottom of the lake, doesn't breathe, doesn't feel uncomfortable, doesn't feel uncomfortable.
15,474,And I'm told that even without the use of purifying magic, if Aquaa itself is immersed in the lake, that will have a cleansing effect.
15,475,It probably means that you are such a holy entity. At the same time, you are a goddess even if you rot.
15,476,The ore in which the aqua is located carried me and Daxnes to the lake.
15,477,Steel ore borrowed something that Guild had always had.
15,478,Some of theques are full of monsters, so it seems that they're for use at such times.
15,479,Nothing. I'm not here to dump useless goddesses into the lake, so I don't have to take them far away.
15,480,At the edge of the lake, you should put enough olives to soak up a little aquaa.
15,481,If a blue-targeter were to attack you during the purification of the lake, you'd be as good as your husband.
15,482,After all, it's used for the heavy work of captured monsters. I don't think I'll get hit by a sharp shot in the Aqua.
15,483,Gild said the monsters would go away from the lake after the purification, but they would put chains of hard-core Ori in case they didn't leave the lake.
15,484,Steel ore has weight, so I brought it to the lake by pulling it to the horse I rented in the city.
15,485,In such a hurry, I plan to get the horse I borrowed to pull the ore in chains and run away.
15,486,The ore in which it was put was sunk by the lake, and the aqua in the gym was bathing the tip of his foot and his butt in the lake.
15,487,All we have to do is stay away from the three of us.
15,488,The aqua-a-a-a-a-c-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- b-a- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b- b.
15,490,I'm like, "What's wrong with you?"
15,492,9
15,494,It's been two hours since I re-cleaning and putting Aquaa by the lake.
15,495,But there's still no sign of monsters attacking us.
15,496,I and Daknes and Ginn were watching Aqua on land some 20 meters from Aqua.
15,497,I'll call out to the aqua where I've been soaked in the water.
15,498,If you want to go to the bathroom, tell me!
15,499,Aquaa screamed back at me from a distance.
15,500,"It's going to be fine! It's going to be fine!"
15,501,You say something like an old idol.
15,502,I'm afraid I'll still be in the water, but I still have a lot of money.
15,503,"It looks like something's going to be okay. Even the Red Charms don't go to the bathroom."
15,504,Megumi is going to say such a thing even though she hasn't even heard it.
15,505,You and Aqua are usually eating and drinking from the remotes, but you're like, "Where's it gone?"
15,506,"I'm a crusider too, so the bathroom is...
15,507,"Dacquenes, don't fight these two guys. The two of you who insist on not going to the bathroom are going to ask for the next time they're going home, and I'm going to make sure they don't go to the bathroom."
15,508,"Oh, no, please don't go to the bathroom, but I'm sorry, so please don't come... but I wish you wouldn't come with me like this.
15,509,I said something that I could only think of as a flag.
15,510,Then, as if to trigger it, a small wave runs through a part of the lake.
15,511,The size of the earth's average crocodile wouldn't change much.
15,512,But it's still a monster. It's different from the crocodile on Earth.
15,513,"Cah, Kazmar! There's something coming! Hey, there's a lot of stuff here!"
15,514,The crocodiles in this world seem to act in groups.
15,516,It's been four hours since we started to clean up.
15,518,At first, it used only the purifying power of the goddess's body in the water, but you want to finish the cleansing quickly and go home. Now you're indisposed to do anything else.
15,519,"Privation"! "Privation"! "Privation"!
15,520,There are a lot of crocodiles surrounding the steel ore where the aqua is, and they're glancing around it.
15,521,I'm in a coma! Olly is making a weird sound!
15,522,Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a--a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-b-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-b-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- (-a-b) in the or-a-a-a-a-a-a- b-a-a-a-a-a- b-a-a-a-a- (-a-a- (a-a-a- (a-a-a- b.) in the-
15,523,"Aquaar, if you want to do it, just say it, and I'm going to drag you down the chain and drag you all the way out!"
15,524,I've been yelling at Oli for a while, but Aquaa was so terrified and stubborn that she refused to accept the Queen's Rituala.
15,525,'Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
15,526,The blue-targeters surrounding Aqua, crying after a while, don't look at the three of us.
15,527,When I look at it, I see the daknes.
15,528,It's like, "What's wrong with you?"
15,529,Don't go, don't go, okay?
15,531,It's been seven hours since I started to clean myself up.
15,533,By the lake, the broken ore was left alone.
15,534,The olives on the blue tartar alligators also have crocodile teeth in some places.
15,535,Because the purification was complete, the blue-targeters separated from the ore and swam toward the mountains.
15,536,I can't hear the pure magic of Aquaa anymore.
15,537,I mean, for an hour or so, I can't hear Aquaa's voice, which was attacked by the alligators.
15,538,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, are you okay?
15,539,We got close to Ori, and we started to smell the aqua in it.
15,540,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
15,541,If I hadn't held my knee and cried, I'd have returned the quest.
15,542,Well, in this situation, it's not possible.
15,543,"Look, if the purification is over, we'll go home and we'll talk about it. We don't need a reward this time.
15,544,I buried my face in my knee in a physical chair, and my shoulders move slowly.
15,545,But there's no sign of coming out of Ori.
15,546,"Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
15,547,To my words, I heard Aqua moaning in a low voice.
15,548,I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll...
15,549,...and...?
15,550,What?
15,551,It's... it's scary out there, so I'm gonna take you to town.
15,552,I'm afraid that this quest was followed by a frog-hunting and then another trauma to Aquaa.
15,554,10
15,556,"Donadnadonardner..."
15,557,"Hey, hey, Aqua, I'm in town now, so stop singing because when you're carrying a woman on your knees, you're getting the attention of the city's inhabitants, right?"
15,558,"No, no, this is my sanctuary. The world outside isn't coming out for a while because it's scary."
15,559,Pulling all the aquas that have been pulled into the ore with horses.
15,562,When we returned to town after we finished our quest safely, we were on our way to Guild with the warm attention of the city's people.
15,563,Despite the fact that Aqua didn't walk on his feet, our steps were slow because he didn't want us to get out of the ore.
15,564,This time, however, about one person has suffered trauma, but none of the other damage has been fatal.
15,565,I wanted to try the equipment and the law against it, but it was easy enough for me to do it, so I'm sure it would be better for you.
15,567,It's rare for us, and it's no big deal.
15,569,It's because I've thought of such a flag.
15,570,"What are you doing there?"
15,571,He's a man who leans over to the Aqua, where he's pulled into the ore. He's a man who leans over and puts iron on his face.
15,572,That's right, the blue-targeter couldn't break the big break, and the lily iron bars were so easily twisted and twisted and reached out to the inside aqua.
15,573,You know, I've been looking at you and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and you've been looking at me, and I've been looking at me, and I've been looking at me, and I've been looking at me, and I've been looking at me, and I've been looking at my hands, and I've been looking at my hands, and I've been like, and I've been like, and I've been looking at my hands, and I've been like, and I've been like,
15,574,"Hey, don't touch my friends like that. Who are you?
15,575,The guy who tried to take my hand got stuck in a dacness.
15,576,Unlike what I envy the aquamarines that have been hit by the alligators, Daxene is now a cruxider who protects and protects his precious friends and doesn't feel ashamed wherever he goes.
15,577,If you've always been like this...
15,578,The man shakes his neck with a sigh.
15,579,It's obvious that I don't want to get involved in a little seduction, but I can't help it.
15,580,The man's attitude, which usually doesn't show a lot of facial expression, was clearly distorted.
15,581,I'm starting to feel like a crescendo, so I can't hold my knees when I'm trying to get out of the cage.
15,582,"Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
15,583,In my whispers, when did Aquau say what, once and for all?...
15,584,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
15,585,Aquaa finally came out of the lily.
15,586,He probably didn't really forget that he was a goddess, did he?
15,587,Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a--- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a--------- a- a- a---------------------------- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- and a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- and a- and a- and a- over and a- and a- and a- and a- and a- and a- and a- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and- and-
15,588,"Who are you?"
15,589,Don't you know each other?
15,590,...no, I still think you know each other.
15,591,It's because the man's eyes are wide open with a look of surprise.
15,592,Maybe Aqua is just forgetting.
15,593,"What are you talking about, woman? It's me! It's me! It's me! It's me!
15,594,"What are you doing?"
15,595,Aqua might still lean, but I've got a pin in my throat.
15,596,The Japanese name for an animated character is probably the one who got Aqua before me and was sent here.
15,597,That man with a sense of justice has brown hair and he's pretty handsome.
15,598,He wore bright, blue, blue, shiny, and shiny armor, and with his hip he wore a little sword that went into black and black.
15,599,And behind you are a beautiful warrior-like girl with a spear and a pretty girl with leather armor and a dagger hanging around her waist.
15,600,Is he as old as I am when he calls himself Misulgi?
15,601,The man said in a word...
15,602,He was the character of a comic book.
15,605,"Oh, there's a guy like that! Sorry, I forgot all about it. I sent a good number of people, and I couldn't have forgotten it!"
15,606,The description of me and Misulgi finally reminded me of Aaa.
15,607,While pulling his young face, the mistletoe laughed at Aqua.
15,608,"Well, it's been a long time since I've been here. As a brave person chosen by you, you've had a hard day's work. The career has gone up to 37....
15,609,Misulgi looks at me and says, "I don't know."
15,610,Did Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-b-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a---- a----- a- a- a- a------ a-- and you- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a---------- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a- a
15,611,I can better tell where I had forgotten to exist and how mean I was to the mistletoe.
15,612,I mean, does Misulgi look like I was keeping Aqua in a cage?
15,613,...no, don't take it normally.
15,614,If he doesn't want to get out of the cage, he won't believe me.
15,615,I can't believe I've seen such a strange goddess with my own eyes.
15,617,Whenever I was with myself, I would explain to Misulgi all the latitudes and all the events that Aqua was supposed to come to this world.
15,619,"What do you think? What do you think? You brought the goddess into this world!
15,621,I was covered in a whirring gurgle.
15,622,The aquamarine is in a hurry to stop it.
15,623,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
15,624,In those words, Misulgi sees Aqua with a wistful eyes of pity.
15,625,I don't know how you got thrown in by a guy like this, but you're being unfairly treated like that, and you're only three hundred thousand...?
15,626,I thought you shouldn't call me a goddess on this street, but I'll keep quiet because I'm about to cut up the mistletoe.
15,627,That's what I'm talking about in my first meeting. This son of a bitch or a son of a bitch.
15,628,You don't know much about Aqua.
15,630,Misulgi's words gave a little push to the aquaa, but he didn't listen.
15,631,"Well, well, I'm sleeping in a stable with you guys, but..."
15,632,"What do you mean?"
15,633,The hand of Misalgi's chest was pressed into my chest.
15,634,It hurts!
15,635,His arm comes from his side with the walrus.
15,636,"Hey, let go of my hand. What are you from just now? You've never met Kazma, but there will be more than you know and appreciate."
15,640,Except when it was time to speak up about stupid things, the quiet Daxness was unusually angry.
15,641,When you see it, it's got a new wand, and now it's got a burst-out cry... and stop it!
15,642,When Misulgi let go of his hand, he will look at the dacquenes and gurney with interest.
15,643,Don't you think you're ashamed to let Akasa and such brilliant people sleep in the stables?
15,644,When I listen to what he says, it makes me feel like I'm on the edge of being so blessed.
15,645,Is that what I look like when it comes to others who have nothing to do with me?
15,646,I listen to Aqua.
15,647,And I said, "Hey, you know, it's basic for adventurers in this world to sleep in a stable.
15,648,He said, "Well, you know, I've given him a sword because I've given him a gift to the foreign world, and I think that's why I've been able to rob the first high-priced ventures, and I've never had a problem with money.... well, that's what it feels like to be given power or equipment."
15,649,Upon hearing Aqua's answer, I became angry at myself for not trying to do anything.
15,650,Why did I have to be taught by the eye of the eye after I've worked so hard in this world after I've lived through my life with a free sword?
15,651,I didn't have my temper like that, and I laughed at her with a mixed look of pity for Aqua or dacnes and gurneys, as if she felt sorry for me.
15,652,"You guys seem to have had a lot of trouble coming with me from now on. Let's not sleep in a stable, let's buy all the fancy equipment, or let's balance the structure of the party.
15,653,Whoa, I'm not in.
15,654,No, of course I don't want to join this guy's party.
15,655,To the suggestion of the selfish mistletoe, three of my associates whispered in secret.
15,656,The personality of a self-surprising gurgi is not a bad suggestion if you want to wait for it.
15,657,And I think it's easier to go along with the mistletoe than I am to go along with it.
15,658,Aqua can't go back to heaven unless the demon king is defeated.
15,659,Even though I was brought here as my extra-world emigration privilege, I'm sure I'll be able to follow other forwarders in the killing of the king and get back home.
15,660,When I listen to the conversation behind me...
15,661,He's really bad, but he's really bad at it. I'm afraid he's got a narcissist in it.
15,662,"Why can't he take something physiologically? I prefer to take it rather than attack it, but I want to hit him in the face."
15,663,"Do you mind if I shoot him?"
15,664,Oh, it's a big disrepute, Miss Misulgi.
15,665,And Aqua pulled my clothes out of the closet.
15,666,"Hey, Kazma, let's go to Gild now. I've given him a sword, but I think it's best not to get involved with him."
15,667,I'm honest with you, I'm angry, but should I just walk away from Aqua?
15,668,I don't seem to want to go to your party after all.
15,669,When I said that, I tried to pull the horse, pull the ore and leave.
15,671,...and...and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and...... and... and... and............................................. and............... and... and.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
15,673,Can you... can you move out of the way?
15,674,I'm going to stand in front of me and I'm going to tell the blocked thurgi with frustration.
15,675,What do I do? I don't listen to people.
15,676,"I'm sorry, but I can't let Aquarity, who gave me the power of a sword, go into such trouble, I can't save this world. I'm the one who's going to take down the demon king. I think it's better for him to come with me....
15,677,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
15,678,As it's a stream that's so confusing and so common, you can see this later development.
15,679,After this, I'm sure he'll...
15,680,"Well, why don't you play with me, because you're the one who's supposed to bring Aqua, and if I win, give it over to Aqua, and if you win, let's do whatever we say."
15,681,"All right, let's go!"
15,682,That's exactly what I expected.
15,683,As I was getting to the limit of my arrogance, I came at you without a second or two.
15,684,I'm going to kick my left hand and I'm going to hit you with my right hand with a small sword.
15,685,You've got to get ahead of me. You've got to be kidding me. You've got to be kidding me. You've got to be kidding me.
15,686,A high-level Thordo Master with a sword would be reluctant to challenge an adventurer with poor equipment!
15,687,You didn't expect Misulgi to come up with a story and be killed at the same time as you answered.
15,688,I'm like, "What?
15,689,It's a panicky gurgi, but it's a driftstone and a high-level adventurer.
15,690,As soon as you pull out the sword in your back against the sword, you'll lie down and pick up my sword.
15,691,As soon as my right hand is struck by a sword, I'll stick my left hand out...!
15,692,"Steel!"
15,693,At the same time as screaming, I feel the weight of a strong sword on my left hand.
15,694,Oh, I think I just got a hit on it.
15,695,From the hand of Misulgi, who was about to take my small sword, the magic sword that had stood or held up to take it was gone.
15,696,"What?"
15,697,Whose is the dumb voice in between?
15,698,It may have been everyone else's voice.
15,699,In the assault on him, with his stolen skill, the mistletoe had no way of handling it, and he was struck in the head with the small sword that I threw down.
15,702,"You cowards, you cowards, you cowards!"
15,703,"You son of a bitch, you coward!
15,704,If you say bad things to me by two girls from Miszulgi's associates,
15,705,I listened intently to it.
15,706,Even if it's too short a time or too short a time, its head is crushed with a heavy short saw, and she's standing with her white eyes on her face.
15,707,I said one-on-one to the two opposing sides.
15,708,He said he'd listen to anything he would say if he lost.
15,709,That word fills up with one of the characters.
15,710,Don't be silly, Baek Seung Jo!
15,711,I turned around at Aqua to the confident girl's words.
15,712,I'm like, "Oh, really? I can't use these spoils, can I?
15,713,"I'm serious, but I'm sorry, the swordgram is only for that painful person. If you're armed, it's for the best. It's for the best. It's for the best.
15,714,Oh, my God.
15,715,But let's take care of it.
15,716,"Well, then, when he wakes up, tell him it's all your fault, so tell him it's none of your business.... then let's go report to Aqua and Guido."
15,717,As I turned my back on my heels, a girl from Misulgi set up a weapon.
15,718,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
15,719,"You're going to give me back my Japanese sword." "We don't approve of winning like this!"
15,720,To the two girls, I showed them my hands.
15,721,"No problem, but I'm a true man and I'm an equalist, and I'm a fair man who gets a girl to take a drop kick. Don't expect me to take care of you, don't you think?
15,722,The two girls who looked at my hand either sensed their danger in a different sense or held back with a nervous look.
15,723,"Oh..."
15,724,That kind of thing hurts the way I look at my friends who are so light.
15,729,We dragged the old ore we had borrowed until we finally got back to Guild.
15,730,Since we decided to give all the good news to Aquaa, I left it up to the Aquars to do the complete report.
15,731,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
15,732,"What's wrong with you?"
15,733,From inside the gills, I heard a shrill aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
15,734,Doesn't he feel guilty if he doesn't make a fuss anyway?
15,735,When I went inside, there was an aquatics that had turned into tears in the eyes of the staff.
15,736,And I said, "Well, I don't know if that's why I'm borrowing it, but I'm telling you that I didn't break it!
15,737,Oh, I see. Didn't you just bend your knee and try to help Aqua?
15,738,It seems that Aqua is getting a request from a broken ore instead.
15,739,It's been a little while longer, but soon you'll give up and come to our table with Sobo for a reward.
15,740,It's like, "You know, I've got this reward, I've got this broken ore money, and I've got a hundred thousand Elliss... and it's made out of special metal and process, so I'm going to make two hundred thousand dollars..."
15,741,I felt a little sorry for the loose aqua, and I felt a little sorry for the driftstone.
15,742,As far as Mizalgi is concerned, Aquaa is nothing.
15,743,"That guy's going to see you again and I'm going to make you eat God's Broome and I'm going to pay you for Oro's ransom!"
15,744,The aqua is sitting on the table, clenching the teeth with a narrow grip on the menu.
15,745,For my part, I don't want to see him anymore.
15,746,...and Aquaa still groans with regret.
15,748,"There you are! I've been looking for you!
15,750,At Gild's entrance, the very topic of the mistletoe was standing with two girls in the band.
15,751,The mistletoe, who suddenly cried out my full name, walked to the table where we were and hit the van and the table with her hand.
15,752,He told me as soon as he heard about you from a stolen girl who was a bandit.
15,753,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
15,754,I know a thief, but the other one is the problem.
15,755,I don't know where I'm going, but there's a rumor that I'm not a demon.
15,756,The aquatics wobble around in front of me with a real face.
15,757,I will take back my sword from this man, and I will surely bring down the King.
15,759,"Oh!
15,761,I was beaten in silence by the Aquaa, and the mistletoe blew up.
15,762,A group of girls rushed over to the bed-rolling mistletoe.
15,763,When I look at my face and I don't know why I've been hit, I'm like, "I don't know why I'm being beaten."
15,764,"Hey, you pay off the money you broke, because that's what I'm going to pay for! It's expensive because it's made of three hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, three hundred thousand of that special metal and process!
15,765,Didn't that lily say two hundred thousand?
15,766,With his body holding down where he has been beaten, with his butt on his back, and with the aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-b-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- b-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-----a-a---a-a-a-----a-a---a-a-a-a., and a-a., and a-a., and a---------- b, and a- b, and a-b, and a- b, and a-a-a, and a- b, and a-a, and a-a, and a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a, and a-a-a-a-a-a, and a-a-a-a-a- b, and a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a- b, and a- b, and a- b, and a- b, and a- b, and a-a-a-a-a- b, and a-a-a- b, and
15,767,When I picked up the money from Miszulgi, Akua picked up the menu again with a hook-up.
15,768,The resuscitated moustache, who takes care of Aquaa with one hand of the menu in order to make a fuss, seems to feel sorry for me.
15,769,I understand that you asked me to do this before you told me to do anything you wanted me to do, but... but please... can you give me back my magic sword? Even if you have it, it's useless. Even if you use it, it's not worth it.
15,770,He's saying it himself, but it's probably quite a good story.
15,771,Even though she's not a little girl, she's been sticking to me for some time as a bonus for emigrating to the world.
15,772,That means that I also bet Misulgi's jugular advantage.
15,773,If you ask me if Aqua corresponds to a sword, I'll have to shut up.
15,774,"Don't you think that I'm going to have to put myself on a show, and I'm going to buy a good sword if I lose, or do you want to say that my value is equal to the highest sword in the store?
15,775,His face turned pale in Aquaa's words, waving his hand against one of the menus.
15,776,Well, in this case, I was able to go on talking on my own, and it's no wonder Aqua would get angry.
15,777,"Wait a minute, Mr. Aqua! I wasn't looking at you cheaply...!"
15,778,It's a panicky gurgle, and when it's ready, it pulls its sleeves with the sleeves of the walrus.
15,779,"What's up, Grandpa?" "What's up?"
15,780,The gurney that attracts the attention of Mizalgi still points at me with its finger.
15,781,To be exact, around my hip.
15,782,First of all, this man doesn't already have a sword.
15,783,"What's the matter with you?"
15,784,(Laughter)
15,785,"Hey, Satoshi Satoru! Where's the magic sword? Where's my sword?"
15,786,I can hold on to it with my sweaty fat floating all over my face.
15,787,I'm just saying.
15,788,"Sold."
15,789,"Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
15,790,Misulgi ran out of the Guild crying.
15,793,"What the hell was that guy?" By the way, they've been calling him "Aqua" and "She's a god," but what are you talking about?"
15,794,After Misulgi ran out of Guild with tears in her eyes.
15,795,As the adventurers stared at the curious eyes of the adventurers earlier, Daxnes said.
15,796,I don't know what to say.
15,797,No, that's the moment. Can I tell Duquenes about it?
15,798,When I look at Aqua, the Aqua will nod as soon as I realize it.
15,799,And the aqua is unusual and serious, and turns around with a dacnes.
15,800,Daknes and Akira also went into the position of serious listening to that aqua crescendo...
15,801,"I've kept my mouth shut until now, but I'll tell you...
15,802,"Have you had a dream?"
15,803,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
15,804,Well, this is what it's going to look like....
15,806,It was then.
15,808,All adventurers will gather at the front gate of the city, armed and ready to fight!
15,809,An announcement of an emergency, with an uncle's appearance and an uncle's appearance, rang all over the place.
15,810,It's been a long time since I've called.
15,811,I gotta go. Are you blind?
15,812,I don't think so, but after that noise with Misulgi, it stinks...
15,814,And when I'm so lazy that it's all over the table.
15,816,I want all adventurers to gather at the front gate of the city, armed and in battle position... especially the adventurer Suto Kazma and his party at once!
15,818,"What?"
15,820,What did you say?
16,4,1
16,6,I hurried to and from the front gate.
16,7,With me as a light-dressed head, I arrived in front of the gate, but only the heavily armed Duquenes were late to wear it.
16,8,"Oh, that's right. That's him again."
16,9,When we reach the front gate of the city, there are already a lot of adventurers there.
16,10,And there were a lot of adventurers in the distance, and there was a guy in front of the city's front gate.
16,11,Well, it's Durahan, the head of that evil king.
16,12,I was worried about the pale faces of the adventurers who were there before, but I looked behind Durahan and understood.
16,13,Today, unlike the other day, I have many monsters behind me.
16,15,It's a bunch of macabre horses dressed in fine armor that rots and crumbles.
16,16,From the edge of the armor, clothing and helmet, it's almost impossible to eat for a while while while you're staring at it, and you've got a rotten body hidden away from you that doesn't seem to be a trauma.
16,17,Those armored knights turned out to be undead in one look.
16,19,When Durahan found out where I was going with him, he screamed at the top of his mouth.
16,20,"Why don't you come to the castle?
16,21,I asked Durahan to come forward in the form of a cover-up.
16,22,"Well, why don't you come to the castle and go?
16,23,When I told him that angry Durahan didn't know what to do with his left hand... he tried to hit the ground and realized that it was his head.
16,24,"You're not even shooting at me?" "You're not shooting at me! You're not shooting at me! You're not shooting at me!"
16,25,"What?"
16,26,I hear it, and then I look at the next bowl.
16,27,It's been a long time since I've looked away.
16,28,You went? I told you not to go! Then you went again!
16,29,It's like, "Oh, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's so bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad.
16,30,"Don't hang around and say, "Well, you can't move if you're a magical shot!
16,31,When I heard what I was trying to tell him, he was pulling his arm around me. Aqua looked out of my eyes.
16,32,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
16,33,"You or oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
16,34,And I said, "Oh! Oh! Oh!
16,35,It's probably because of your pretending to do your job that you get pissed off at work.
16,36,Durahan went on with his words as he was wearing a collar of a aqua neck trying to escape.
16,37,"This is not the only thing that really bothers me! Aren't you going to help your people? Before I was punished for wrong reasons, before I became a monster, I was going to be a good knight.
16,38,When Durahan went so far as to say so.
16,39,The dacquenes who finally arrived stood next to me.
16,40,Durahan was praised for his knight's tour, and his eyes met with the red-faceed Dallas.
16,41,Well... well...
16,42,Duquenes, I'm sorry to bother you, but please raise your hand against Durahan...
16,44,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
16,46,When Durahan saw it, he made a crazy sound.
16,47,I don't see that look because of the helmet, but maybe it's why!
16,48,"What?" "What?" "What?" "What?" and "What?" and "What?" and "What?" and "What?"
16,49,It seems that the Aqua is having a real good time and laughs at Durahan.
16,50,I can't see my face as always, but thanks to Durahan's shaking shoulders, I'm sure he's furious.
16,51,But since Aquaa has lifted the curse, we know that he's setting a trap, and there's no reason for us to bother going to such a dangerous place.
16,52,You know, if I wanted to, I could kill every one of the adventurers in this city and kill them all. Don't you think they'll let me get away with it?
16,53,Aqua-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a, but then you get to the limit.
16,54,But Durahan was screaming for his right hand before he could do anything.
16,55,I'm the one who's got no reason to miss it, but I'm not going to let you get away with it.
16,56,The hand that Aqua thrusts out gives off a white light.
16,57,But even if Aquahan sees magic, Durahan doesn't try to avoid it, as if he's good enough to eat it.
16,58,I'm sure Sakura is very confident.
16,59,The soft light of Durahan's body, the light of the Aquaa at the center of his body, came on!
16,60,I'm sorry to hear that this army of Undead men, under the protection of the Witch King, will take a strong stand against sacred magic.
16,61,The spelled Durahan is blowing black smoke out of the light.
16,62,Durahan's confidence was so strong that he lifted black smoke from all over his body, shook himself, and held on.
16,63,Look at that, Aquaa shouts.
16,64,And I said, "Well, you know, it's weird, it's not working!"
16,65,No, it looked like it was working pretty well, but it was screaming...
16,66,Durahan was moaning.
16,67,I'm the last person to hear the explanation. I'm the Verdia of Durahan, and this armor with special protection from the evil king, and by my power, there's no turning-and-deads around there!
16,68,As I said, Durahan bent over the head of his hand looking at Aquaa.
16,69,I wonder if it's a way to pull my head off.
16,70,"--well, it's okay. Actually, there was a strong light falling all around this town, and our fortune-tellers came to investigate because of the noise...
16,71,Verdia, who made all the unreasonable statements like Jain, held her head on her left hand and raised her empty right hand high.
16,72,"Oh, I don't have to go out of my way to deal with him. Come on, guys, let's show these guys what a prison is!"
16,73,"Oh, my God, he was so scared by the unexpected magic of Aquaa that he was going to run off to safety and use his men to attack him!"
16,74,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
16,75,Sayid turns dead!
16,76,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!"
16,77,Verdia, who was trying to say something, cast a spell on Aquaa and screamed.
16,78,There was a white crescendo at Verdia's feet, and there was a beam of light coming up from there toward heaven.
16,79,Verdia spits out black smoke from all over her armor, rolling around the ground as if it were a fire on her body.
16,80,(Laughter)
16,81,"What's wrong with him? He can't work my magic at all!"
16,82,She said, "Oh, I feel like it's working really well."
16,83,No, the actual turn-and- die would have to kill the undead with one shot at a time.
16,84,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
16,85,I'm like, "Oh my God, that's... that's what I'm talking about!
16,86,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
16,87,"Current the people of the city... kill them all!"
16,88,I shook your right hand!
16,90,2
16,92,Undead night.
16,94,It's a high-end zombie canine-compatible monster.
16,95,They've got their armor firmly fixed, though they're a threat not to be high-end criminals.
16,96,(Laughter)
16,97,"Who wants to go to the Ellis Church and get some holy water?"
16,98,Despite the roars of such a huge adventurer from all over the city, the Undead Nights broke into the city.
16,99,The adventurers trying to catch them up somehow.
16,100,And I'll laugh at Verdia as if she were laughing at them!
16,101,"Kha-ha-ha-ha, come on, give me your desperate cry..."
16,102,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
16,103,And I said, "Oh, wow! Why are you always going after me? I'm a stubborn woman!
16,104,I'm like, "Oh, my God! I'm really good at what I do in my day, but why is there an Undead Night in Aqua?!"
16,105,Aquamarines, who shouts something that's not godlike at all, and Daqnes who's jealous and jealous and who's screaming things that can't be helped.
16,106,The Undead Knights didn't mess with the city's inhabitants, but somehow they were just chasing around Aqua.
16,107,I'm like, "Oh, my God, you guys!
16,108,Verde, who saw it, is making a nervous voice.
16,109,Do the stray lesser undeads, without will, instinctively seek salvation from the goddess Aquaa and go away?
16,110,I don't know why Aquaa is being chased around by the undead, but now is the time!
16,111,I'm like, "Hey, don't you want that band of undead men to blow up a bomb?"
16,112,"Oh, it's all over the city, and if you don't get together, and if you don't, you're going to blow your gun..."
16,113,And then.
16,114,(Laughter)
16,115,Aquaa came running for me with a large army of undead knights.
16,116,Hey...!
16,117,I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'll go over there and I'll buy you tonight's dinner!"
16,118,"I'll buy you a drink, take care of this undead! What's wrong with these undead people? Even the turns dead can't go away!"
16,119,What are you doing, bitch? ! ! ! What are you doing? !
16,120,No, wait, wait, wait...?
16,121,I'll be waiting for you outside the city.
16,122,And I said, "Well, you know what?"
16,123,One word at a time, I was chased out of town by Aqua.
16,124,That, on purpose, passes the adventurers who are fighting against the Undead Night and rubs as many undead knights as possible on the Aquaa as possible.
16,126,And...!
16,127,I'm like, "Oh my God, there's something behind me! There's an undead night all over the city!"
16,128,When I look back, behind the aqua there's a swarm of Undead Nights.
16,129,Me and Aquaa left town, followed by the Undead Night leaving town, and the blink of an eye.
16,130,"Do it! Do it!"
16,131,At my signal, I took off my eyeband and put on my staff and made both eyes shine.
16,132,My name is Kazma, and I am the master of demons, and I am the master of demons, and I am the master of demons, and I am the master of Babylon!
16,136,The explosive magic of the party's heart bursts into the heart of a pack of undead men!
16,138,3
16,140,The explosive magic that created a huge crater right in front of the city's front gate and wiped out every undead.
16,141,Everyone is swooning back into that magic and powerful majesty.
16,142,I don't think anyone will be able to speak at the sight of my explosive magic.
16,143,That's how I heard the song of victory and pride.
16,144,"Do you have a fur?"
16,145,"Oh, please. I can't move well. Can you wear my eyes?"
16,146,A little bit from the ground away.
16,147,There's a bowl lying on its face, with its strength running out.
16,148,If I held the spoon in my hand and put on my eyes, I would carry it on my back.
16,149,"In the mouth... in the mouth... in the mouth... in the mouth..."!
16,150,AAa, which was near the most undead night, came walking toward me, half crying and throwing sand in her mouth.
16,151,It's been reported that the ground was rolled up by the explosion's magic aftereffects.
16,152,I still can't stand the smoke bombings, and I can't hear voices from adventurers all over the city.
16,153,I'm like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
16,154,"The crazy red-driven girl did it!"
16,155,I'm like, "What's wrong with my name and my head? I'm just going to do it right when I'm doing it!"
16,156,I heard the cheers coming from the city, and even my back was crawling.
16,157,"I'm sorry. I'd like to blow up on them, so please take me closer."
16,158,I'm sure you've run out of magic, but today you've done a lot of work, so be confident and rest up.
16,159,I don't like those words, but I'll hold on to them as if they were safe.
16,160,Of course there's some soft stuff on my back.
16,161,Things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things... things...
16,162,...it seems to be attached to a thorax, but it seems to be, and there's no feeling of touch...
16,163,...well, I'm a Loli, and I don't know if I can do it.
16,164,"The Red Charms are extremely intelligent."
16,165,I don't know what to say, but I just burst into that sort of thing on my back.
16,166,(Laughter)
16,167,I thought he was... he's the type of guy who's always trying to get along with you.
16,168,To make it easy for me, I'm going to be strangled by the chrysanthemum.
16,169,And at the entrance of the city, Verdia was staring at us like that.
16,170,To be exact, I'd like a pair of my backs.
16,171,In time, Verde began to shake his shoulder.
16,172,Is he angry that his undead people have been completely wiped out?
16,173,No.
16,174,"Cah-ha-ha! That's funny! I didn't really think I'd be able to wipe out the distribution in this big city!
16,175,Hey, wait a minute.
16,176,Hey, wait!
16,177,I'll take care of you myself!
16,178,Verdia, who was at the entrance of the city, ran for her life!
16,180,4
16,182,It's faster than Verdia gets to us.
16,183,A lot of adventurers will surround Verdidia with a zilzilli and a long circle so that they can take arms and protect us when they're attacked.
16,184,Verdia saw it, held her head in one hand, held her sword in the other, and wiped her shoulders in a freshly prepared manner...
16,185,I'm the one who's most interested in it, but... if Kuk-Kon could hit me at all, then I'd get news for the fact that I don't have a lot of money.
16,186,The word "competitive" fills the hearts of the adventurers who were surrounded by a siege.
16,187,And a warrior-like man...
16,188,"Hey, no matter how strong you are, don't put your eyes behind your back!
16,189,From the side of Verdia, I cried out to the impudents around me.
16,190,What a dead flag!
16,191,And he said, "Hey, this is the head of the demon army, and it's easy to beat it with such simple hands!"
16,192,I'll warn the warrior-like man who said his line like a dog.
16,193,At the same time, I'll use the sword to support them...
16,194,... ...no, think hard and see the results when I'm at a very low level.
16,195,Above all, now I'm taking my back pads to a safe place...
16,196,...and carry it and then?
16,197,We don't have magic powers anymore.
16,198,Aqua spell can't be fatal.
16,199,Shouldn't we all just leave?
16,200,When I think about it, the warrior-like man that surrounded Verdia is about to come upon me right now!
16,201,"If you've got time and you've got enough money, you'll soon get this town's ticket, and when he comes, he'll be the head of the Chaldean army, and it'll be over!
16,202,In front of a man who was about to come up with such a cry, Verdia threw her head high into the sky.
16,204,...this town's bid?
16,205,Who is he? He's a brilliant adventurer with no fame in this city?
16,207,While I think about it, the neck of Verdia is thrown, with the front of her face pointing to the ground.
16,208,The moment I saw it, I looked around.
16,209,Not only did I realize it, but the adventurers around me also noticed it.
16,210,Stop it! Don't go...
16,211,I'll raise my voice to stop the nameless adventurers...
16,212,Verdia acts as if she had an eye on her back.
16,213,"What?"
16,214,That's the voice of the cut-out adventurer.
16,215,What kind of adventurer said that?
16,216,Verdia, who fought all the attacks with one hand and held the great sword with her two hands...
16,218,Verde killed all the men who were killing, and in the blink of an eye.
16,220,People who lived a short time ago will easily lose their lives in front of their eyes.
16,221,I know this world's reality in terms of its sheer absurdity.
16,222,The men who make a noise and break down.
16,223,When she heard the sound happily, she put her hand up.
16,224,Verdia's head falls on that level.
16,225,As if the series of moves were nothing, Verdia took it easy.
16,226,Who's next?
16,227,To those words, the adventurers with whom I've been living were giving way to despair.
16,228,A girl screamed.
16,230,"Oh, you're... you're going to be killed with a single shot if Miss Misulgi comes in here right now!"
16,232,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
16,233,I can't stop thinking.
16,234,Misulgi, I took away the sword and sold it...
16,235,"Hey, I'm going to hold on a little bit.
16,236,And I said, "Well, you know, you said Verde, and there's also this town!
16,237,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
16,238,As I turned blue, I looked toward Aqua, and there was no sign of Aqua that I should have been there the last time.
16,239,Aquaa, who had the power to bid only on other than honeygis, didn't look at the verdia she wanted to confront the adventurers, stood near the bodies of the slain adventurers, touched the bodies, touched them with what they thought they were supposed to be.
16,240,I wonder if I'm going to pray for the dead to live like a god and woman.
16,241,I can't tell you how many adventurers have been killed in the face of a seemingly gregarious verda, but no one's going to stand up to...
16,243,"You're next to me?"
16,245,Verde was holding her head in her left hand and her big sword in her right hand.
16,246,You stood in front of Verde in the form of a cover-up, and you happily stuck your head out of the top of your hand.
16,247,Daquenes is no longer a pervert, and he is no longer shy where he comes from.
16,248,Verde has taken advantage of the power of the Aqua Remnant, and probably has been a big watcher about what's going on in Dallas.
16,249,Verdia lost control of herself while facing the Dukes.
16,250,The thick white armor of Duquenes is shining as if it were against the black armor of Berdia.
16,251,The adventurers who came upon Verde were also wearing armor.
16,252,But the head of this demon army ripped off every piece of armor he was wearing.
16,253,Can Daxness, who claims to be harder than anyone around the time, endure the attack on Verdia?
16,254,When I'm worried about whether I should stop or not, he's confident about it.
16,255,"Don't worry, Kazma. I can't beat anyone. Besides, your skills are good for the weapons and armor you own. Be sure that Verdia's sword is a good thing, but it doesn't just cut metal armor into pieces and pieces of paper, does it?
16,256,Today's Duquenes is rare and aggressive.
16,257,But even if I could defend myself, in your case there wouldn't be an attack.
16,258,"Don't do that. It was amazing not only for the attack but also for the escape, right?" "You can't be so clumsy as to be able to hit an adventurer with what he didn't get."
16,259,In my words, Duquenes remains in constant contact with Verde.
16,260,I want you to do something that you can't let go.
16,261,I don't know what you're talking about, but it's also a reason why you can't give up the dacnes.
16,262,When I didn't say anything, Daxnes started running toward Verdia with his great sword in his eyes!
16,263,"Oh, come on! As a headless knight, he's no match for a saintly knight. Let's do it!"
16,264,Verdia will take a shot to catch it.
16,265,Whether Duquenes saw the great sword holding both hands and didn't want to accept it, Verde is bowing down and showing her how to avoid it.
16,266,In that Verde, Daxnes has a great sword to beat his whole body...!
16,267,Have you overlooked the measurement of the angle? I hit the ground a few inches before Verdia's foot.
16,268,"What's the... what's the...?"
16,269,Verde makes a faint sound.
16,270,I'm looking at the dacness and dacness, but with similar eyes, other adventurers were looking at him.
16,271,I'm ashamed to take it off even if it doesn't work anymore!
16,272,She's one of mine!
16,273,I've heard stories like that, but it's hard to believe...
16,274,Duquenes, who missed the target, said that it's always the wrong thing to do.
16,275,Were you ashamed to take it off after all that dressed up, or were you just blushing?
16,276,I don't know if this was a hit angle, but Verdia put herself in a lower position, lower, and more awkward position.
16,277,What a disappointment. That's enough.
16,278,In a tone that seemed like Verdia was dealing with a boring person, and she made sure that she didn't build a sword against Dukeness.
16,279,"Well, the next person..."
16,280,He was confident that he had struck it down.
16,281,But Verde's sword only pulled the surface of Daquenes 's armor with a loud and loud sound.
16,282,When does Duquenes take his distance from Verde?
16,283,"Oh, my God, my new armor!"
16,284,After staring sadly at the big wounds made of armor, she glances at Verdia.
16,285,The damage to the armor is great, but it's not such a wound that can reach the body from Dukeness's body.
16,286,I mean...
16,287,"Well, why can't you take my sword and cut it?
16,288,I get caught in the crowd among other traitors by the whims of Verdia who made a fuss about me.
16,289,It's like, "Oh, my God, I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. I can't do this."
16,290,"Dacquenes, you can withstand that man's attack!
16,291,Daknes nodded in my words, and his eyes nodded at Verde.
16,292,I'll leave it to you, but you'll also give me a chance to give this guy a chance, please!
16,293,I called out to the adventurer who was close to me, to tell him that I knew what he wanted.
16,294,"What's wrong with you?" I said, "What's wrong with you?"
16,295,To my call, the wizards, who remembered their work, began to prepare their magic, and the other adventurers started to wonder if there was anything they could do for themselves.
16,296,This is a war with the king's executive.
16,297,There's a big enemy in the city of the adventurer, and there's no reason for us to go home safely.
16,298,And Verdia pointed to the wizards who put their swords into the ground and opened them with their right hand and sang the magic.
16,299,"You're gonna die in a week!
16,300,Verde put a curse on the death sentence to the wizards who were singing to do magic.
16,301,The fact that they were sentenced to death caused the wizards to panic and stop singing one after the other.
16,302,The other wizards who were about to enter saw the death sentence and hesitated to speak the magic while holding on to their faces.
16,304,Fucking Durahan, you're using your disgusting hands!
16,306,"Well, let's try it for real this time!"
16,308,As Verdia screamed, she threw her head high into the sky again.
16,309,I wonder if I can ask that bowman to shoot me down.
16,310,When I was thinking about it, Verdia grabbed a big sword with both hands and came up with it!
16,311,The part of the helmet's face was thrown down again.
16,312,With their heads thrown into the air, they're looking across the field from the sky.
16,313,If you do that, there will be no blind spots in Verdia, and if you shake a sword, you'll be able to guess where the opponent is going.
16,315,"Cah! Kazma!" "Daknes..."
16,316,There was a scream from behind.
16,318,This place is surrounded by most of the city's adventures.
16,319,The familiar person and the guy who taught me the weakness of monsters.
16,320,The girl who took a bow in her hand and told me that she had a drink called Neoid.
16,321,Even that old man who made fun of me for taking a spear, trying to get behind Verdia, at Gild and not having a drink.
16,322,If Duquenes collapses, Verdia may feel free to kill everyone in this room.
16,323,Is that why you know this? In the approaching Verdia, the Daquenes will keep their eyes open, and they will return with their widest swords, and they will put their swords in front of them, and they will stand on top of them as if they were on their shields.
16,324,Except for the head that doesn't wear helmets, he's always asking me to shoot him.
16,325,I'm like, "Oh, I'm so proud of you!"
16,326,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
16,327,One, two, three, four!
16,328,The cut-and-a-half is so quick that every time it pulls a metal, there are countless stab wounds on the armor of Daknes.
16,329,A parallel adventurer could easily have been torn to pieces by a shooting, but Daxness was not moved by the slightest movement but was blocked by a block.
16,330,The dacquenes 'knee's long hair gilded on the sword, and some of them float into the air.
16,331,Verdia once stopped a fierce series of attacks and took her head off the sky with one hand... and then after she was so impressed by the toughness of Dukenes, she shakes a sword with one hand.
16,332,The wizards who saw Daxness endure.
16,333,People standing there in shock with their blue faces...
16,334,Like I had made up my mind, I began to say magic again.
16,336,...and there's something going on in my bowl.
16,338,It was wiped with the armor of your hands...
16,339,"Hey, Duquenes, you're being wounded! Get back! All the adventurers, run to pieces and start over!"
16,340,When I looked at him, he was bleeding from the edge of his fine armor and from place to place.
16,341,I call out to Duquenes like that, but he doesn't go away.
16,342,"Classers can't go back and say, "Classers can't go back and look for someone who's protecting them!"
16,344,The Daquettes are so hot, they're so desperate, they're so desperate, they're going to continue their mortgage...!
16,346,"And this Durahan, he's really good at it! He's going to rip off my armor a little bit from the start... he's going to leave a piece of armor in front of the public and he's going to shame me in front of the public!
16,347,"What?"
16,348,Whenever I blink in the words of Duquenes, I'll stop for a moment, and in Verde I'll push my hand hard, and I'll slap on a real pervert who isn't broken at such a time.
16,349,"It's time to think about it," he said.
16,350,If I had to say something, I'd call it "Dacquenes" and shake.
16,351,Whenever you're hurt by Durahan in public, even if it's just a cup in front of the public, and then it's all the way up to Kazma...
16,352,"What?"
16,353,"What's wrong with you?
16,354,The water magic that was released in the dacquenes in the vulnerabilities.
16,355,Along with my screams, there was an all-out thrust over the heads of Dukenes and Verdia.
16,356,It's as if the bucket was turned upside down and a lot of water was thrown out on them.
16,357,Duquenes covered his head with heavy water, and Verdia flew away from the water that was blown down by the sea.
16,359,...and...?
16,361,Why is Verdia so upset...?
16,362,...and the dacquenes, covered with water from their heads, lit their faces with a spark and crushed them.
16,363,I don't like these things. I don't like them, but I really want you to think about times...
16,364,"Hey, no, no, this isn't a weird play! This is what we do!"
16,365,It's only the primary magic of freezing water that goes on.
16,366,It's a magic that doesn't work at all by itself.
16,367,I'm like, "Oh, you're trying to freeze my foot... and you think I'm just trying to get my strength out of the way?
16,368,Verde, who's frozen the ground under her feet, will learn the skills of real life before she says anything.
16,369,That's right. That's my biggest weapon I've ever used in my life!
16,370,"If it's hard to avoid it, that's enough!
16,371,They broke apart the skill, the stick, and the skill to take away what the other person had at random.
16,372,There's magic and skill in this world.
16,373,They are used with something other than physical strength, which everyone has, magic power.
16,375,That's a good idea.
16,376,It's said that just because I forgot to use it, there used to be a lot of people on Earth who used magic in the past.
16,378,The more magic you get, the more skill and magic increases strength and increases success.
16,379,I'm going to make a break in Verdia, and I'm going to be at the best moment of my life, and I'm going to be at the best of times... and I'm going to be at the most...
16,380,I'm sure it wasn't a bad hand, but I'm still in charge of the Demon King's rank. If I hadn't gotten a little more different from you, I might have been in danger.
16,381,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and . . . . . . . . . . . . and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
16,384,Verde points to me.
16,385,I'm sorry, Sakura is a high-level member of the evil king's elite.
16,387,. ..and Verdi's sooner than she curses me.
16,388,Don't touch my people!
16,389,Usually, the cool dacquenes expressed unusual emotions and cried out, threw away the heavy, unspoiled sword, and hit me from the shoulder against the verdia.
16,390,But in spite of her frozen footings, Verdia clenched her big sword with enough ease and ease to cover herself.
16,391,Duquenes threw a heavy sword in order to jump.
16,392,In other words, I have nothing to protect myself from Verdia's sword.
16,393,When I noticed, I was screaming around.
16,394,We're going to win if you take a sword from him and we're going to win!
16,395,Maybe there's someone who's on a higher level and has better luck than me.
16,396,Before I knew it, some bandits who had come by with their hide-and-seek skills showed up from there at my call.
16,397,"Steel!"
16,398,But the stick that's been worked out one after another doesn't have any effect.
16,399,Verdia didn't seem to care about the crowd anymore, but she took her sword to the defenseless Duquenes... and once again threw her own head high and high again.
16,400,"Oh!
16,401,When I see it, I'm going to scream from the blasphemers.
16,402,It's because after Verde threw her head, there will be a hell of a fight with both hands.
16,403,I'm like, "What's wrong with you?"
16,404,The daknes are tiny and bloated when they see it.
16,405,Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
16,406,What should I do in such a situation?
16,408,I don't have special powers, and I don't have hidden talents.
16,410,There's nothing to be proud of, and there's no skill to be useful in this scene.
16,411,It's better luck than people.
16,412,After that, I learned of the game that I grew up in when I was a kid.
16,413,Every day, I got caught in a game, and I was lazy, and I came around here.
16,414,Are we going to end up in this strange world where we're so excited to be able to do nothing?
16,415,"Daknes! Kazma! Daknes!"
16,416,The honey cries out in pain behind me.
16,417,Remember, this is Durahan. What was the weakness in the roll-playing game?
16,418,All I have to do is take a quick look at how to attack online games against people and how they hate each other.
16,419,Watch him closely.
16,420,Why did he get so far away from my water?
16,422,It's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
16,424,...flowing water.
16,425,It's something that major undead monsters and vampires don't like.
16,426,Well, what about Durahan?
16,427,"I've had a good time, Kulceader! I'll give thanks to the King for being able to take care of you!
16,428,"Create Water."
16,429,"What's the matter with you?"
16,430,Right now, the Verdia who was about to take over the Dukees...
16,431,You don't get into the Dukes, you stop at the spot.
16,432,In the end, I took my own head that fell without a sharp shot.
16,433,I mean, I'm really serious right now.
16,434,Instead, the wet, even more wet, Daquenes is going to say a lot of spite.
16,435,Normally, I apologize, but it's far from that right now.
16,436,I screamed.
16,438,"It's water. It's water."
16,440,5
16,442,"Creation Water!" "Create Water." "Create Water."
16,443,"Huh-oh-oh!"
16,444,I'm the first person to be used by some kind of evil spirit.
16,445,The water poured down from above her head, and Verdia was muttering.
16,446,Damn it, I know it's weak, but there's no attack!
16,447,The other wizards are in a hurry.
16,448,At this rate, we're all going to run out of magic before we're all in Verde.
16,449,And in that kind of way.
16,450,"Hey, what the hell's going on?
16,451,Let's knock this guy out.
16,452,My desperate water magic told me that Aquaa, who had been away for so long, walked here and there.
16,453,"It's water! It's water! It's water! It's water! It's water!
16,454,"You're about to get one of the punishments, impertinent, because you're the true goddess of water to remember, not barely!
16,455,Can you do that? !
16,456,No, if you can get it out, do it fast!
16,457,"I'll apologize to you later, but if you can't get me out of here, get me out of here!
16,458,And I said, "Oh, oh, my God, you're a goddess right now! Look, I'm going to show you what's really going on!"
16,459,A word to sell and a word to buy.
16,460,In my words, Aqua came out one step ahead.
16,461,There's a sort of fog around that aqua.
16,462,What?
16,463,And I'm like, "What's wrong with me? What's wrong with me?"
16,464,Verdia sees Aquaa and stops moving.
16,465,I wonder if a driftstone is the head of a magic king.
16,466,It must have been a disturbing feeling about what Aqua was going to do.
16,467,In other words, those who could use magic around them looked at the Aqua with an air of uncertainty.
16,468,The Aquaa, who didn't care what was going on around it, crushed it with a clumsiness.
16,469,"I belong to you in this world."
16,470,The fog that appeared around the Aqua is floating around as a small water ball.
16,471,I can feel each one of those little water balls congealed to the point where it's so strong that it's so strong and it's so tight and it's so tight and it's so tight and it's so tight and it's so tight and it's so tight and it's so tight and it's so tight.
16,472,"The goddess of water, Aqua..."
16,473,I have a bad feeling about this.
16,474,When the air around you trembles and trembles, it feels like this.
16,475,This turbulent air is similar to that of a nuclear bomb blaster.
16,476,I mean, you're about to use that dangerous magic...
16,478,I'm sure Verdia felt the disturbing air with which she wanted to go.
16,479,Verdia turned her back on Aquaia, without hesitation, and tried to get away quickly...
16,481,...and Duquenes stood in front of it!
16,483,Aquaa spread out her hands.
16,484,Sayid Creation Water!
16,485,He said the magic of creating water.
16,487,6
16,489,Sure, Aqua said it.
16,490,Even the water from the flood class could be released.
16,491,"Hey... wait...!"
16,492,"Oh, my God, there's water, there's water!"
16,493,I started my goal, Verdia, the Dacquenes and the adventurers around. And I was away from home, and even a magical aqua...
16,494,I'm like, "What's wrong with you?"
16,495,Don't let go!
16,496,All the people on the spot were swept away by the water that suddenly burst out.
16,497,The volume of that water is so large that it lifts a huge balloon in front of the city's main gate and then flows to the center of the city.
16,498,In time, the water came down, and then the adventurers who fell to the ground and...
16,499,"Hey... hey... what are you thinking... are you a deer or a horse?"
16,500,Likewise, a limp Verdia stood up standing up, smiling.
16,501,I'd very much like to agree with Verdia's opinion, but now I'm not saying such a thing.
16,502,Now's your chance.
16,503,"Now's my chance, my life is so exciting, my life is so weak, why don't you take this opportunity?
16,504,Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
16,505,I'll stick my hand out to Verde...
16,506,"This time I'll take your weapon away!"
16,507,I'm like, "Hey, tell me you've weakened, but I'm not going to let you steal my weapon with a wild-stupid sticker.
16,508,Verdia, who was facing me, screamed at me, then threw her head up again, and with both hands she would put her fists into the air, and then she would throw her glasses out of the air.
16,509,As a matter of fact, I'm sure Sakura is a member of the evil king's elite. Even though he's supposed to be weak, he's going to start shaking his legs just to face each other.
16,510,No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
16,511,"Steel!"
16,512,I ripped all the magic Stills apart!
16,513,At the same time, I was able to reach both hands with a heavy weight, along with my hands in a hard, cold manner.
16,514,It's like, "Oh, I didn't want to do this," and then I think of something that's going to be a flag.
16,515,I'm sure I couldn't have done it.
16,516,"Oh...
16,517,A voice of disappointment came from the adventurers around us.
16,518,When I look at Verde, I see her holding her sword with her hands.
16,519,I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
16,521,...I didn't let go, but I stood there alone.
16,523,...and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and............ and......... and... and... and......... and... and... and... and...... and... and... and... and............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
16,524,When everyone in the room doesn't know what's going on, they're quiet and quiet.
16,525,I heard a loud voice, which seemed to be in trouble, terrible fear, and a small voice.
16,526,"Oh, uh...
16,527,It was Verde's voice.
16,528,Verdia was shaking a thin voice.
16,529,Can I get my neck back?
16,530,Verdia's head started to swell between my two hands.
16,532,...and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and...... and... and... and... and... and... and............... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and.............................. and........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
16,534,I'm like, "Hey, guys, let's play soccer!
16,535,I kicked Verde's head in front of the adventurers!
16,536,"Oh, oh, oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
16,537,Verdia's head, which was kicked and rolled, was turned into a toy of the adventurers who had been waiting for so long.
16,538,I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
16,539,"Hey, over here!
16,540,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
16,541,Verdia's body, which is kicked in the head, has a sword in one hand and is in a state of panic without seeing the front.
16,542,"Hey, Daknes. You want to feed each other?"
16,543,I picked up my fallen sword and handed it over to Duquenes, who came up in a wet, wet breath, and then the dacquenes, who had blood and water poured from all over the place, got ready to stand in front of Verdia's body.
16,544,In the meantime, I give a little invitation to Aqua.
16,545,As soon as Aquaa noticed it, she was running towards me.
16,546,Duquenes, raise your great sword wide...!
16,547,"This is for those who have been killed by you and who have taken care of me!
16,548,I threw down my sword with all my heart.
16,549,"What?" "What's wrong with you?"
16,550,Verdia's head, which had been kicked in the distance, was moaning out of the crowd.
16,551,One of the tough but strong dacquenes blasts will crush the black armor of Verdia, crush it, break it, and cut a big wound to the chest of the unrecognizable.
16,552,I'm sure Verdia said this.
16,553,With this armor under the protection of the Lord the King.
16,554,Aqua, please.
16,555,I'm in charge!
16,556,Part of the armor was broken, and the hand of Aqua was turned to Verdia, where it was weakened by the water.
16,557,Sayid turns dead!
16,560,"Hey, wait... oh, oh, oh!"
16,561,I can hear Verdia screaming in the form of the law in Aquaa, from the feet of the adventurers.
16,562,It looks like the next turn-and- die worked on the driftstone.
16,563,Verdia's body is wrapped in white light, and it will become thin and disappear.
16,564,Verdia's neck was gone, and the adventurers who enjoyed soccer were screaming.
16,566,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
16,568,7
16,570,While listening to the victorious adventurers, the wounded Daquenes closed their eyes with a piece of knees and a prayer in front of the place where Durahan's body disappeared.
16,571,It wasn't until I got home that I realized that I wasn't going to be able to do anything about it.
16,572,"What are you doing?"
16,573,Duquenes answered that he had his eyes closed and that he should have a blank.
16,574,I don't think I want to be a monster with this guy.
16,575,I see... and the daknes continue.
16,576,I mean, you know, I was like, "Oh, you know, I've got to get into a bunch of monsters when they put me in a party for a whole day, and I've got to get in a fight with them... and they've got to get in a fight with me, and I've got to get in a fight with them... and they've got to get in a fight with me, and I've got to get in a fight with them... and I don't like them... and they've got to get in a fight with me.
16,577,(Laughter)
16,578,"Well, let's go back to Guild."
16,579,You rush to cut off the subject, don't listen to it or listen to it.
16,580,Duquenes kept his eyes closed and groaned with a gentle voice.
16,581,If I could see them again... I'd have wanted to have a drink at one time or another...
16,583,"Oh..."
16,585,I heard a silent voice coming from behind Duquenes, who was closing his eyes.
16,586,The three men behind the shakers and dacnesses.
16,587,That was certainly the three people who were supposed to have been killed by Verde earlier.
16,588,In time, one man seemed to be sorry...
16,589,"Well, you know, I'm sorry for everything.
16,590,"Oh... oh, I'm so sorry. I've heard so much talk about losing my arm sumo... because I'll buy you a drink next time..."
16,591,Did you really care that the sword didn't strike?
16,592,Daknes, who had closed her eyes in prayer to the three words that are being uttered one after the other, began to shake small and turn red.
16,593,The voice that was supposed to be there, Aqua said it without reading the air.
16,594,"Dacquenes, I'll take care of you! You'll be dead and you'll be dead!"
16,595,Aquaa probably didn't mean any harm.
16,596,But in those words, Duquenes remembered his own uniqueness, which he didn't even know was behind him, and he sat down with his eyes full of tears in his red face.
16,597,"It's good to see you guys again. Come on, let's go have a drink."
16,598,When I spoke out loud to Daknes, he kept his face covered with his hands.
16,599,"I want to die..."
16,600,That's what I'm talking about.
16,601,"You've always wanted to be blamed, haven't you?" "Don't worry, I'll keep talking about this for three days."
16,602,And I said, "You know, this charge isn't the same as the kind of shame I want."
16,603,Duquenes shook his shoulder.
17,3,The day after Verdia felled the forest.
17,4,I was walking alone to Guild, thinking about the future.
17,5,All I had to do was cut down the king.
17,6,But then I'm going to have to deal with strong enemies like Verde.
17,7,I'd like to perform the killing of evil spirits and make a wish come true.
17,8,Or will you give up the slaughter and find a place to live in this world?
17,9,...of course the answer is obvious.
17,10,I'm in the lowest position, and I'm never going to win so well in the future.
17,11,From now on, we'll live a slow life without danger.
17,12,We do business with Japanese knowledge.
17,13,While doing a safe job, I'm sometimes looking for a sharp, sharp knife, and I'm doing a simple quest.
17,14,Thinking of the future design of life, I put my hand to the entrance to Guild the blasphemer.
17,15,When you open the door, the smell will come back on your nose.
17,16,A person's heat and the smell of alcohol flow out of the entrance I opened.
17,17,It seems that the adventurers are having a feast in the middle of the day on the anniversary of the defeat of the leader of the Demon King.
17,18,"Oh, my God, it's so late! We're already ready!"
17,19,As I stepped into the Guild, Aquaa laughed at me on the back of my machine.
17,20,"Hey, Kazma, get the money!
17,21,I've opened my bag with news on it and showed it to me.
17,22,He's making a lot of money too.
17,23,What's going on with the old limit on drinking in this world?
17,24,When I look at it, the adventurers in Guild are too happy to be able to walk most of them.
17,25,I'll head to the counter.
17,26,There was already a daknes and a gurney there.
17,27,"Here you are, Kazma. Here you go, take your reward."
17,28,"I've been waiting for you, Kazma. Listen, Daxnes, I don't want to drink too much and I don't want to...
17,29,"No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
17,30,Since they're doing well, I stand in front of my sister at the reception.
17,31,And then the old sister who was familiar with me looked at me and she looked at me and she looked at me with a faint look.
17,32,"Oh, that's... that's Mr. Sautkazuma, isn't it?" "I've been waiting for you."
17,33,...?
17,34,The attitude of the sister in the receptionist reminds me of the difference.
17,35,Well... first, it's a reward for both of you.
17,36,Your sister said that she handed a small bag across a dacquenes and gurney.
17,37,What about mine?
17,38,I have a sister who's wondering about me.
17,39,Actually, there's a special reward for Ms. Kazma's party.
17,40,What are you talking about?
17,41,"What? Why are we alone?"
17,42,Someone answered my question.
17,43,"Hey, MVP, if you weren't there, Durahan wouldn't have killed you!"
17,44,To that voice, the drunken people who make a fuss about it.
17,45,These guys...
17,46,As it has been a long time since I've come to this world, I've been blind to its kindness.
17,47,On behalf of the four of us, I'm going to receive a special reward.
17,48,The older sister at the reception, she coughs a lot with cophones and... and...
17,49,To Mr. Sautkazma's party, I will give you 300 million yen of gold in honor of the triumph of Verde, the head of the Shah.
17,50,"What?"
17,51,We were like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
17,52,When the adventurers heard that, they would come back to their senses.
17,53,And...
17,54,"Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
17,55,Kazma, buy me a drink!
17,56,It's called the adventurers' buy-out.
17,57,Oh, yeah!
17,58,"Hey, Duquenes, there's one thing I'm going to tell you! I'm going to have less adventures in the future!
17,59,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
17,60,"I'm in trouble, too. I'm going to follow the Kazma, and I'm going to take down the demon king and get the name "the most powerful maneuverer."
17,61,In Guild's room, the two screaming words go out of the air, and it's going to go up and up.
17,62,The receptionist with the look on her face was handing me a piece of paper.
17,63,That's a piece of paper with zero levels of paper.
17,64,A check for this world?
17,65,A drunken Aqua is in a mood that follows me and comes next to me and peeks through my own paper from the side.
17,66,"Oh, well, this time, with a large amount of water called for to exude Mr. Kazma, the houses around the entrances of the city have been swept away, damaged, damaged, damaged...
17,67,When the receptionist's sister says so, she will take a quick glance and pull it back.
17,68,Seeing my paper, I ran away for a while.
17,69,Then the neck of the aqua neck is going to run away, and the collar is going to be quick and quick.
17,70,The adventurers who saw the sum of our request took a quick glance.
17,71,Dacquenes, who was watching the bill, put his hand on my shoulder with a pontoon...
17,72,Kazma, I'm going to go to the quest for a strong opponent who's going to make money tomorrow.
17,73,Duquenes said such things, but he laughed at me with a smile, though he was very happy and happy.
17,74,. ..and live the rest of your life in this endless and absurd world with all those people you can't control?
17,75,...as soon as I closed my eyes, I decided to cut down the magic king.
17,77,To get out of this fragile world!
17,78,Thank you very much.
18,0,It's all right. It's all right.
18,3,First of all, thank you for getting this book.
18,4,Thank you, and it's nice to meet you. I'm really sorry.
18,5,The truth is, this work was on the site "Let's Be a novelist." But this time, I called Mr Sneaker's library, and it was carried on by his own confession.
18,6,Thank you, thank you...!
18,7,Well, since it's our work in such a situation, some readers will already be able to predict future developments.
18,8,But the author doesn't want to do that. I always want to go over the reader's expectations.
18,9,So I think it's a matter of changing the story development and everything else.
18,10,There's already a lot of things going wrong.
18,11,So if you're careful when you know it's going to happen, one day a bunch of cans of coffee that you've heated in a stove will blow up, and the hero will die. From the next roll, you might start with a new hero, or you might be looking forward to something like that.
18,13,- Then explain our work a little bit.
18,14,This work isn't about gentle, cool, and cool heroes who are quick to live, or about a boy who makes an effort that no one can beat, or about serving his purpose in the end of his ordeal.
18,15,If someone's in trouble in front of me, I'd like to help him up, maybe take off his hat, maybe be a pretty girl, and I don't want to work if I have a lot of money.
18,16,It's a hard story to take along with us some decent heroines, despite the unjust realities that are going on in a terrible and extremely foreign world that are all over the place.
18,17,It's not a matter of being chosen or legendary, it's also a secret power, and it's also a hero whose character is no match for anything other than good luck than good luck.
18,18,Such a boy will grow up running and fighting against his enemies.
18,19,...no, I don't think I'll grow much.
18,20,It's not something that can be changed so easily as human beings.
18,21,But I'm sure he'll do something in the end.
18,22,- Well, then, it's nice to meet you again.
18,23,All of you from the Sneaker Library editors, and let's get a good look at your school, your salespeople, your designers.
18,24,A lovely illustration has been painted for you. You've been in charge of a great deal of confusion and hardship for Mr. Kojiji, and for authors who don't know either the right or the left.
18,25,It's thanks to your willingness to support such a clever author.
18,26,Thank you so much.
18,27,I don't know how to say it, but I'm going to go ahead so that I can write better work in the future.
18,28,I'm sure writing white-collar things will be the most rewarding thing I've ever done for you.
18,30,- And finally.
18,31,If you read the book in "Let's Be a novelist," those who have heard the cheers.
18,32,Above all, thank you very much for the reader who took this book and read it!

21,3,I'd like to thank you for buying a volume of ebooks.
21,4,"Mr. Aquaa."
22,0,"Sensei! Isn't that Mr. Aquaa?"
22,1,When Aquaa and I were walking down the street, a good gentleman said that.
22,2,...Mr. Aquaa?
22,3,"Oh, somehow, the houseman. It's not odd."
22,4,"Well, somehow, home... where are you today, Mr. Aqua?
22,5,The person who calls Aqua a teacher seems to be a steward of some great house.
22,6,"I don't want to be kept waiting for you, but as a substitute for the pictures that I've ruined, I'm just saying I'm sorry, and I'm not going to draw no matter how much I'm loaded up with money."
22,7,If you thank me, I'll think of a lot more than money.
22,8,"Hey, hey, Aqua, what's going on? I don't know what's going on, so tell me what's going on."
22,9,I can't keep up with you, I ask Aqua.
22,10,And I said, "Hey, why don't you tell your kids about baseball and play with it?"
22,11,"And the teacher said that because she didn't have enough money to pay for it, she would draw something instead...
22,12,Isn't it great or not?
22,13,No, it's great to draw a picture that's so easy for a nobleman, but the reason why I ruined it is that you...
22,14,"Well, I'm not a painter, so I'm not going to get any money. I'm going to have to come and cool down some magic shop. I'm not going to talk about painting."
22,15,"Well, I'm not going to give up on you."
22,16,The gentleman left with a feeling of regret.
22,17,"If you're so good at painting, why don't you eat with it?"
22,18,"No, I'm a woman, aren't I?" "I'm a woman? I'm proud of this job. I don't know if I want to work for the rest of my life."
22,19,When I was trying to make Aqua cry, I saw a figure appear to block it.
22,20,"What's wrong with you, Master? What's wrong with him?"
22,21,"Oh, my disciple, this man is an evil man who harms me!
22,22,"I'll leave it to you, Master!"
22,23,"Hey, wait...!"
22,24,- He showed up suddenly, and he came at me, and he was a disciple of Aquaa, and he was in a state of stupefying with his magic.
22,25,A man who is possessed by magic and can't move can look down while breathing heavily.
22,26,"What the hell is this guy doing as a master?"
22,27,"He's my self-named disciple, but if you're a sculpturer and you're wearing the sacred symbol of the Axes religion on the door of a shop, you're going to have to get adopted."
22,28,"No, no, no, no, you can't let Wiz into the store. You're hanging around in places I don't know. You're not a dog or a cat. You should be interested in anything and you should fix your neck."
22,29,And I said, "Well, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my job and my name," and he said, "Well, you're going to change my perception of me.
22,30,"You're the geisha, aren't you?"
22,31,I'll make you eat the holy goo in your face!
22,32,That's when Aqua was trying to get in touch with me.
22,33,The girl who tried to run by us fell down suddenly.
22,34,She's falling down pretty fast and she's skimming on her knees and arms and so forth.
22,35,I'm like, "Oh... oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
22,36,I cried a lot from day to day, cried like someone else somewhere, and got a girl pissed up.
22,37,And Aquaa, when she bends in front of him,
22,38,Now, get up, and you're so pretty, and you'll ruin it if you cry.
22,39,I don't know if I've ever done anything like that.
22,40,"Wuh..." "Wuh..." "Wuh..."
22,41,"Look, I can't help it anymore, okay? I'm going to show you all this stuff. Come on, from inside this handkerchief, let's... "
22,42,For a girl who still doesn't stop crying, it seems that Aqua is going to show her tricks and stop her crying.
22,43,I'll help you.
22,44,When I turn my back on Aqua and the girl, my father, who was opening a stall nearby, gave me some of the broth he used to sell...
22,45,"Hey, nature preserve monsters, pale purple butterflies..."
22,46,I'm like, "Oh my God! My sister's amazing!"
22,47,When I looked back in haste, there was already a lot of people there.
22,48,"Hey, little guy, do it again!"
22,49,"Hey, sis, I want to see it again..."
22,50,One more time! One more time!
22,52,"It's a problem, but when people make it, it's a problem. I'm a writer, so I don't want to be asked for a show!"
22,54,I think you should change jobs once and for all.
22,55,Thank you very much.
23,3,The cover, the mural, the text, the illustration.
23,4,(Laughter)
23,5,(Laughter)
24,0,Happy birthday to the world!
24,1,Oh, my God, woman.
24,2,When I'm mad, when I'm mad, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared, when I'm scared,
